depicts the adventures of characters A long time ago in a galaxy far far away5 in which humans and many species of aliens often humanoid coexist with robots or droids who may assist them in their daily routines space travel between planets is common due to hyperspace technology678 A mystical power known as the Force is described in the original film as an energy field created by all living things  that binds the galaxy together9 Through training and meditation those whom the Force is strong with are able to perform various superpowers such as telekinesis precognition telepathy and manipulation of physical energy10 The Force is wielded by two major knighthood orders at conflict with each other the Jedi peacekeepers of the Old Republic who act on the light side of the Force through nonattachment and arbitration and the Sith ancient enemies of the galactic democracy who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression While Jedi Knights can be numerous the Dark Lords of the Sith or Darths are intended to be limited to two a master and their apprentice11 Forcewielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the rest of the average population The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called lightsaber which is the cylinderlike hilt of a sword when turned off but when turned on ignites a blade of energy that can cut through virtually any surface Battles between the two factions result in duels which are a mix between sword skills and the use of the Force The rest of the average population as well as renegades and soldiers use laserpowered blaster firearms the deadly beams of which Forceusers can deflect using lightsabers Fictional timeline Three ages are presented within an extended timeline12 The Age of Republic The era of the prequel trilogy in which the democratic Old Galactic Republic is corrupted by its Supreme Chancellor Palpatinesecretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious After orchestrating the Clone Wars between the government and a

with the death of the Emperor17 The surviving Rebellion gives rise to the New Galactic Republic181415 The original trilogy depicts the galaxy as dirty and grimy in George Lucass depiction of a used universe19 The Age of Resistance The era of the sequel trilogy in which the remnants of the Empire reform as the First Order20 Heroes of the former Rebellion aided by the New Republic lead the Resistance against the oppressive regime and its rulers the mysterious being known as Snoke and his puppet master the revived Palpatine21 The films made a return to what J J Abrams called the

action figures List of Kenner Star Wars action figures Star Wars The Vintage Collection Lego Star Wars List of Lego Star Wars sets Star Wars trading card and Star Wars roleplaying games George Lucas made much of his fortune by retaining his rights to the franchises merchandising The success of the Star Wars films led the franchise to become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world While filming the original 1977 film George Lucas decided to take a 500000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchises merchandising rights By 1987 the first three films have made US26 billion in merchandising revenue175 By 2012 the first six films produced approximately US20 billion in merchandising revenue176 Kenner made the first Star Wars action

Topps in 1977186 Dozens of series have been produced with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States Some of the card series are of film stills while others are original art Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare promos such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II floating Yoda P3 card often commanding US1000 or more While most base or common card sets are plentiful many insert or chase cards are very rare187 From 1995 until 2001 Decipher Inc had the license for created and produced a collectible card game based on the franchise Themes See also Star Wars sources and analogues Star Wars features elements such as knighthood chivalry and Jungian archetypes such as the shadow188 There are also many references to Christianity such as in the appearance of Darth Maul whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil189 Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth and is assumed to be the Chosen One a messianic individual However unlike Jesus Anakin falls from grace remaining evil as Darth Vader until Return of the Jedi According to Adam Driver sequel trilogy villain Kylo Ren who idolizes Vader believes he is doing what he thinks is right190 George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption191 The saga draws heavily from the heros journey an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell189 Each characterprimarily Anakin Luke and Reyfollows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal becoming the villain192 A defining step of the journey is Atonement with the Father193 ObiWans loss of a father figure could have impacted his relationship with Anakin194 whom both ObiWan and Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to195 Lukes discovery that Vader is his father has strong repurcussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most influential plot twists in cinema196 Supreme Leader Snoke encourages Kylo Ren to kill his father Han Solo190 Kylo uses the fact that Rey is an orphan to tempt her into joining the dark side197 According to Inverse the final scene in The Last Jedi which depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke and one boy using the Force symbolizes that the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings198 Historical influences Political science has been an important element of Star Wars since the franchise launched in 1977 focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship Darth Vaders design initially inspired by Samurai armor also incorporated a German military helmet199200 Originally Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel served Adolf Hitler this was condensed into one character in the form of Darth Vader201 Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German shock troopers Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II202 and political and security officers resemble the blackclad SS down to the stylized silver deaths head on their caps World War II terms were used for names in the films eg the planets Kessel a term that refers to a group of encircled forces and Hoth after a German general who served on the snowladen Eastern Front203 Shots of the commanders looking through ATAT walker viewscreens in The Empire Strikes Back resemble tank interiors204 and space battles in the original film were based on World War I and World War II dogfights205 Palpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to Hitlers role before appointing himself Führer202 Lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar Napoleon Bonaparte and politicians like Richard Nixon206207e The Great Jedi Purge mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives209 The corruption of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire210211 On the inspiration for the First Order formed from the ashes of the Empire The Force Awakens director J J Abrams spoke of conversations the writers had about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after WWII and started working together again20 Cultural impact Main articles Cultural impact of Star Wars and Star Wars fandom It has been suggested that Star Wars fandom be merged into this article Discuss Proposed since September 2019 The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture212 with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life213 Phrases like evil empire and May the Force be with you have become part of the popular lexicon214 The first Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier215 enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people216 The film can be said to have helped launch the sciencefiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s making sciencefiction films a mainstream genre217 The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages with popular examples including Hardware Wars Spaceballs The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot Chicken Star Wars In 1989 the Library of Congress selected the original Star Wars film for preservation in the US National Film Registry as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant218 The Empire Strikes Back was selected in 2010219220 35mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints221222 but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases223 Industry The original Star Wars film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox and was credited for reinvigorating the company Within three weeks of the films release the studios stock price doubled to a record high Prior to 1977 20th Century Foxs greatest annual profits were 37 million while in 1977 the company broke that record by posting a profit of 79 million205 The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate224 Star Wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films switching the focus of Hollywoodmade films from deep meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict themes and irony to sprawling specialeffectsladen blockbusters as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways Before Star Wars special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s225 The commercial success of Star Wars created a boom in stateoftheart special effects in the late 1970s224 Along with Jaws Star Wars started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important226216 It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did215 The original Star Wars trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history227 Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by Star Wars including Damon Lindelof Dean Devlin Roland Emmerich John Lasseter228 David Fincher Joss Whedon John Singleton Kevin Smith229 and later Star Wars directors J J Abrams and Gareth Edwards230 Christopher Nolan cited Star Wars as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film Inception231 Lucass concept of a used universe particularly influenced Ridley Scotts Blade Runner 1982 and Alien 1979 James Camerons Aliens 1986 as well as The Terminator 1984 George Millers Mad Max 2 and Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings trilogy229 Regarding the return and expansion of the franchise Lawrence Kasdan noted that the spinoffs were expanding the franchise into more of a shared universe beyond the previously linear saga adding that one of the strengths of the franchise was how it all fell under the same continuity in comparison to other franchises Kasdan also contrasted Star Wars to the Marvel Cinematic Universe noting that Star Wars features less comedy than the latter and adding that he felt a more comedic approach would not be Star Wars to him232233 Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies Like The Birth of a Nation and Citizen Kane Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after It began a new generation of special effects and highenergy motion pictures The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new highconcept genre for filmmakers to build upon229 Finally along with Steven Spielbergs Jaws it shifted the film industrys focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fastpaced bigbudget blockbusters for younger audiences205234235 Some critics have blamed Star Wars and Jaws for ruining Hollywood by shifting its focus from sophisticated films such as The Godfather Taxi Driver and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy and for the industry shift from standalone one and done films towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels236 One such critic Peter Biskind complained When all was said and done Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films to the simplicities of the pre1960s Golden Age of movies They marched backward through the lookingglass236237 In an opposing view Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws Lucas and Spielberg didnt betray cinema at all they plugged it back into the grid returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow a magic act one big special effect which was a kind of rebirth235 Fan works Main article Star Wars fan films The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own noncanon material set in the Star Wars galaxy In recent years this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films In 2002 Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues however the contest was initially open only to parodies mockumentaries and documentaries Fan fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow inuniverse fiction entries238 Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction as long as it does not attempt to make a profit239 Academia As the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource For example a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by roleplaying action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audiovisual scenery to enhance their performance240 Others have used the films to encourage secondlevel students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers241 Similarly psychiatrists in New Zealand and the US have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology242243 See also
