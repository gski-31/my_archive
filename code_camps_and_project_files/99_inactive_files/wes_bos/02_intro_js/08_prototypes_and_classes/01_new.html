        /* The new operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function. The new keyword does the following things:

        • Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object;
        • Links (sets the constructor of) this object to another object;
        • Passes the newly created object from Step 1 as the this context;
        • Returns this if the function doesn't return its own object.         */

        console.dir(myDate);
        console.log(myDate.getFullYear());

        // everything is technically "new" when declared but some such as array and objects are literal from brackets and parentheses

        function Car(make, model, year) {
            this.make = make;
            this.model = model;

        console.log(car1 instanceof Car); // true

        // using the "new" keyword creates an instance of the called function
