									  limited to: name, phone number, and email address. Such personal information allows us to provide services and features
									  that most likely meet your needs. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for
									  achieving this purpose.
									  <br><br>
									  In general, you can browse the Site without providing us with any personal information about yourself. Once you agree to
									  provide us with personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may
									  require you to provide contact and identity information and other personal information as indicated on the forms
									  throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which are optional. You always have the
									  option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.
									  <br><br>
									  We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site. We use this information to do internal
									  research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect, and serve you and our
									  community. This information may include the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, your computer browser
									  information, and your IP address.
									  <br><br>
									  If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect and retain such information in a file
									  specific to you.
									  <br><br>
									  From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Site. If you choose to
									  participate, we will request certain personal information, including your email address, from you. Participation in these
									  surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
									  The requested information typically includes contact information and demographic information. We will not share the
									  personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you
									  prior notice and choice.
									  <br><br>
									  If at some time, we develop a referral service, and you elect to use such referral service to tell a friend about the Site,
									  we may ask you for your friend's name, email address, and other information. We will automatically send your friend a
									  one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. QRGameplan stores this information to track the success of the
									  referral program.

									  your personal information, including your email address, to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit
									  consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal
									  scope of business to provide our services:
									  <br><br>
									  <b>External Service Providers:</b> There may be separate services offered by third parties that we refer to as external
									  service providers that may be complementary to your use of the Site. If you choose to use these separate services, disclose
									  information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use
									  of your information is governed by their privacy policy. We do not disclose your personal information, including your email
									  address, to external service providers unless you provide your explicit consent. With your consent we may provide some of your
									  personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent our disclosure
									  of your personal information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services.
									  Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to
									  use their services.
									  <br><br>
									  <b>Internal Service Providers for Our Operations:</b> We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers
									  to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product, and service operations that we provide to you and
									  therefore we may provide some of your personal information, including your email address, directly to these internal service
									  providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions
									  that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced
									  QR Game Plan related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses.
									  If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is
									  governed by their applicable privacy policy.
									  <br><br>
									  <b>Legal Requests:</b> QR Game Plan cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws,
									  such as: intellectual property rights, fraud, and other rights, to help protect you and QR Game Plan from bad actors.
									  Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal
									  investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number,
									  email address, username history, and fraud complaints without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect
									  your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without
									  a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of
									  information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity.
									  <br><br>
									  Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal
									  information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting
									  the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information, including your email address, to the government or third
									  parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications,
									  or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry
									  standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or
									  private communications will always remain private. See "Security Section" below.
