That's where we come in, to provide timely roundups of everything 
your friends expect you to know, along with the insight that you crave. To bring you up to speed, in our <a class="a2" 
href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/10/smartphone-buyers-guide-the-best-phones-for-atandt-verizon-spr/" target="_blank">December buyer's guide</a>, at first blush you might have thought we 
were doing an overview of the best Android phones on the market. That's because of our 16 highly-esteemed handsets, a whopping 13 of them had Google's operating system at the core. As you'll see, 
the landscape has changed somewhat, and these new contenders that have come out swinging.</p> <p>We've broken down this buyer's guide by mobile carrier, each including the best handset money can buy, our favorite QWERTY alternative, and the most well-rounded budget phone available (with 
$79 as the absolute ceiling). For smaller US providers, we're providing a single selection, though we're confident it's a good one. You'll definitely be presented with some difficult choices, but that's 
merely a testament to the abundance of stellar phones that aggressively compete for your dollar. With that said, let's dive in &amp; it's roundup time.</p>  <h2>Verizon</h2> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/02/droid-charge-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4149787" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-droid-charge.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>The <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/droid+charge/" target="_blank">Droid Charge</a> from Samsung is hands-down the most desirable VIP pass to Verizon's LTE network. 
Granted, the <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/18/htc-thunderbolt-review/" target="_blank">HTC Thunderbolt</a> will also get you there, but its poor battery life and hotspot 
cycling issues are difficult to ignore. Meanwhile, the Charge's pedestrian exterior belies the overall satisfaction you'll find with this device &amp; immediately apparent once its Super AMOLED Plus 
display comes to life. At its core is a wonderfully responsive Hummingbird processor, and the 1,600mAh battery promises to carry you confidently throughout the day (and well into the next). The $299 
price tag may be difficult to swallow, but it's offset by Verizon's inclusion of a massive 32GB microSD card. Topping it all off, the Charge sports an HDMI port for quality entertainment and a camera 
that's sure to thrill.</p> <h5>If a keyboard is what you're after...</h5> <p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/13/droid-2-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4149789" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-motorola-droid2-global-qwerty.jpg" align="left" /></a>The <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Droid2Global/" 
target="_blank">Droid 2 Global</a> is the finest QWERTY handset you'll find on Verizon, and we say that without reservation. First off, it doesn't have much competition &amp; its closest rivals are the 
<a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/05/motorola-droid-pro-first-hands-on/" target="_blank">Droid Pro</a> or an aging <a class="a2" 
href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/26/blackberry-bold-9650-hands-on-yeah-its-a-tour-with-an-optical/" target="_blank">BlackBerry Bold</a>. Fortunately, this Android slider provides a solid option 
with a 1.2GHz processor and support for roaming abroad. Its keyboard is spacious, and while it's not perfect, even those with big fingers should get along just fine. The 3.7-inch, 854 x 480 display 
provides some appreciated space when compared to typical WVGA offerings, however its 5 megapixel shooter will leave you begging Motorola to take photography more seriously. All in all, the Droid 2 
Global is a bit of a compromise, but if you're willing to accept the trade-off, it can be yours for $149 on contract.</p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/15/lg-vortex-puts-a-verizon-spin-on-budget-android-yes-bings-t/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4154764" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-vortex-1306133295.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>The Vortex is a re-badged LG handset that's linked to its familiar <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/OptimusOne/" target="_blank">Optimus One</a> heritage. Unlike its siblings, 
however, this phone received a make-over by Verizon, which subverted Google's software by pre-installing Bing Maps and Bing Search onto the device. That's not to say it's a bad thing, but it's a 
departure from the norm for this series. The Vortex features 3G Mobile Hotspot connectivity, along with Skype and VZ Navigator. You'll find the phone houses an admirable touchscreen, along with a 
really solid camera. Unfortunately, Verizon seems intent to charge for its custom work on this LG, seeing that its Optimus counterparts on Sprint and T-Mobile are free.</p>  <h2>AT&amp;T</h2> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/22/iphone-4-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4149800" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-iphone4.jpg" 
alt="" width="400" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>AT&amp;T is now flush with stellar top-shelf offerings, including <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/motorola/atrix-4g-review/" target="_blank">Motorola's Atrix 4G</a>, the <a class="a2" 
href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/13/samsung-infuse-4g-review/" target="_blank">Samsung Infuse 4G</a>, and yes... <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/iPhone4/" 
target="_blank">Apple's iPhone 4</a>. While the choice was by no means easy, we continue to be enamored by this stalwart companion. For daily use, the iPhone 4 delivers the most balanced 
approach to consumer needs by providing snappy performance combined with battery life that's a cut above the rest. Its Retina Display remains the standard for comparison, and while the screen is 
small, reading text on web pages is a thoroughly pleasurable experience. A year after its introduction, the iPhone 4 still packs serious multimedia prowess &amp; the 5 megapixel camera captures 
beautiful imagery, and the iPod functionality simply can't be beaten... though, <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/11/google-music-beta-walkthrough-what-it-is-and-how-it-works-vide/" 
target="_blank">Music Beta</a> is certainly gunning to level that playing field.</p> <h5>If a keyboard is what you're after...</h5> <p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/11/lg-quantum-first-hands-on/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4149801" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-lg-optimus-qwerty.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Sure, the <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/lg+quantum/" 
target="_blank">LG Quantum</a> is unlikely to win a Hamilton in any beauty contest, but encased within its rubbery exterior you'll find a QWERTY keyboard that's really quite decent. Once in hand, 
your impression of its frumpy appearance will quickly melt away, thanks to its curvy lines and soft-touch shell. The WP7 slider features a 1GHz Snapdragon, 16GB of internal storage, and a 3.5-inch, 800 
x 480 display that's sufficiently bright and clear. The Quantum's 5 megapixel camera features a dedicated 2-stage shutter button, though its lens is easily outmatched by more sophisticated offerings. 
Grab this handset for $49 on contract, and you just might realize that beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder.</p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/22/samsung-focus-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4149803" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-samsung-focus.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>If your primary objective is to score the most phone for the least amount of coin, the <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/samsung+focus/" target="_blank">Samsung Focus</a> is 
unequivocally the best find on AT&amp;T. For a minor outlay of cash, you'll be treated to an excellent Super AMOLED display, a speedy Snapdragon processor, and a 5 megapixel camera that's quite 
splendid. Yes, its 8GB on-board storage is small, but you can expand the overall capacity with a <a class="a2" 
href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/15/windows-phone-7-certified-microsd-cards-emerge-at-atandt-stores/" target="_blank">"certified"</a> microSD card. Voice quality is superb on the Focus, 
thanks to the phone's top-notch earpiece and ambient noise filtering. All these virtues are packed into a 10mm slim device, and you'll have trouble finding a suitable alternative at twice the price.</p>  <h2>Sprint</h2> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/10/nexus-s-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4154942" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-samsung-nexus-s-4g-1306139372.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>Sprint knew well before releasing the <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Nexus+S+4G/" target="_blank">Nexus S 4G</a> that it had a winner on its hands. What else could you 
expect when snappy WiMAX gets added to one of the best Android phones on the market? While the 5 megapixel camera doesn't reach the top echelons of shooters, it'll satisfy most needs with 
aplomb. What's more, the phone includes NFC support, which is good insurance for the future. Perhaps most importantly, however, the Nexus S 4G delivers a stock Android 2.3 experience that 
enthusiasts will adore and everyone else will appreciate without realizing why.</p> <h5>If a keyboard is what you're after...</h5> <p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/16/epic-4g-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4149893" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-samsung-epic-4g.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>For those who love big, spacious keyboards, the <a class="a2" 
href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Epic4G/" target="_blank">Samsung Epic 4G</a> is an absolute triumph. Its five-row QWERTY is revealed by a sliding mechanism that's sturdy and confident, letting 
you compose long messages while proof-reading on that beautiful 4-inch, 800 x 480 Super AMOLED display. Naturally, the handset blazes thanks a 1GHz Hummingbird processor paired with Sprint's 
WiMAX network, and the camera is an absolute delight. Unlike the original GSM Galaxy S phones, the Epic 4G includes an LED flash that's got you covered in low-light situations. Although its 720p 
video capture isn't perfect, it's still quite pleasing, and we really appreciate Samsung's inclusion of a VGA cam up front. There's a lot to love with this one, and it can be yours for $149 on contract.</p> <a href="http://mobile.engadget.com/2010/11/05/lg-optimus-t-and-optimus-s-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4154770" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-optimus-s-1306133617.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>The <a class="a2" href="http://mobile.engadget.com/tag/optimus+s/" target="_blank">LG Optimus S</a> is a fantastic bit of engineering and, unless you're shooting for the high-end, this should 
absolutely be your next phone on the Now Network. The handset is eminently capable, featuring zippy performance, a pleasing touchscreen, and a sensible camera that's controlled from a 2-stage 
shutter button. While we'd love to see an LED flash, it's easy to appreciate the inclusion of a compass, accelerometer, GPS navigation, and mobile hotspot capabilities. If you're not sure whether 
Android is just a passing fad, Sprint invites you to take the OS for a two-year test drive &amp; and it's footing the bill.</p>  <h2>T-Mobile</h2> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/20/t-mobile-g2x-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4149816" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-tmo-g2x.jpg" 
alt="" width="400" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>The <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/G2x/" target="_blank">G2x</a> currently sits atop a rather high pedestal over at T-Mobile. That's because it's brought NVIDIA's 1GHz 
dual-core Tegra 2 along for the ride &amp; where it meets a vivid 4-inch IPS display, an excellent 8 megapixel shooter, and a 1.3 megapixel cam in front &amp; all encased within an elegantly thin 10mm 
profile. What's more, this multimedia powerhouse beautifully captures video at 1080p for display over HDMI. The G2x ships with a stock version of Android 2.2, and while it's not Gingerbread, we're big 
fans of vanilla Froyo around these parts.</p> <h5>If a keyboard is what you're after...</h5> <p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/06/t-mobile-g2-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4149817" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-htc-g2-qwerty.jpeg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Previously holding T-Mobile's pole position, the <a class="a2" 
href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/t-mobile+g2/" target="_blank">G2</a> continues as the best QWERTY phone on the network. Once you get past its unique "z-hinge" feature, you're presented with 
one of HTC's finest keyboards to date. While the 800MHz processor is being lapped by the competition, it'll easily keep pace with most common users thanks to stock Android underpinnings. 
Photography lovers will appreciate the dedicated 2-stage shutter button, which commands a 5 megapixel camera and LED flash. The 3.7-inch, 800 x 480 touchscreen features a Super LCD display, and 
while its visibility fades in direct sunlight, its beautiful in more suitable conditions. The G2 remains one of the most desirable phones available, and can be yours for $149 on contract.</p> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/21/nokia-astound-for-t-mobile-coming-april-6th-for-80-hands-on-wi/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4149819" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-nokia-astound.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>The <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/c7/" target="_blank">Nokia Astound</a> represents a rare opportunity for budget-oriented consumers. Wrapped inside this gorgeous 
handset, you'll find an eye-catching AMOLED display that stays bright and vibrant when outdoors. Turn the phone around and you'll discover a stellar Extended Depth of Field camera that's paired with 
a dual-LED flash. While the focus-free nature of this lens means you'll struggle with macro shots, EDoF actually enhances the already smooth 720p video capture. Surprisingly, the Astound also 
features NFC, which is uncommon at any price. Users will need to wait for a software update to enable the functionality, however, since it's disabled by default. If you're looking to turn heads without 
breaking the bank, the Nokia Astound will surely fulfill its promise.</p>  <h2>US Cellular</h2> <a href="http://mobile.engadget.com/2010/10/07/samsung-galaxy-s-meets-us-cellular-mesmerize-coming-on-october/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4149820" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-samsung-mesmerize.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>US Cellular is a regional provider that openly prides itself on treating customers fairly. It's also started taking the Android platform very seriously, and the <a class="a2" 
href="http://mobile.engadget.com/tag/mesmerize/" target="_blank">Samsung Mesmerize</a> is the clear front-runner of the pack. Users will find a brilliant Super AMOLED display, a nimble 
Hummingbird processor, and a camera that's thoroughly competent for still pictures and 720p video. While 384MB of RAM is a bit tight, we're rather pleased by the inclusion of an LED flash on this 
CDMA variant. Quite simply, everything about this phone falls right into place.</p>  <h2>Cricket, MetroPCS, and Virgin Mobile</h2> <a href="http://mobile.engadget.com/2010/11/05/lg-optimus-t-and-optimus-s-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4154773" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-lg-optimus-one-1306133665.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>At the risk of sounding repetitive, we really like the <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/OptimusOne/" target="_blank">LG Optimus One</a> entry-level candybars. In fact, you've 
already seen it (twice) as our budget pick for Sprint and Verizon. While locating a good handset on regional and MVNO carriers is sometimes a mixed bag, LG hit it out of the park with this one. Put 
simply, it's a well-built, fully-featured phone that's reasonably speedy and doesn't bite off more than it can chew. Users are treated to a rather nice display, integrated WiFi, Bluetooth 2.1, AGPS, a 
compass, and an accelerometer. The camera pleases, and even though we'd love to see an LED flash playing accompaniment, you're sure to capture some really attractive photos given sufficient 
lighting.</p>  <h2>Cincinnati Bell</h2> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/22/samsung-galaxy-s-review-shootout-captivate-for-atandt-and-vibrant/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4154774" 
src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/05/sbg-2011-samsung-vibrant-1306133691.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="192" align="top" /></a> <p>Cincinnati Bell is a newcomer to the list, but the carrier's AWS service is rather popular in its home territory that's bunched around southeast Indiana, southwest Ohio, and northern Kentucky. Its 
subscribers have several smartphones to choose from, including the <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/06/dell-streak-review/" target="_blank">Dell Streak 5</a> and <a class="a2" 
href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/11/dell-venue-pro-aka-lightning-first-hands-on/" target="_blank">Venue Pro</a>, several BlackBerry handsets, and a smattering of Androids from Motorola, 
Huawei and Alcatel. For us, though &amp; and this goes for Cincinnati Bell customers &amp; the <a class="a2" href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/vibrant/" target="_blank">Samsung Vibrant</a> is 
certainly the phone to buy. We think its Super AMOLED display is absolutely alluring, and we're quite pleased by the photography skills in this Galaxy S handset. Unfortunately there's no LED flash, but 
we'll keep driving this point home until manufacturers take note. Meanwhile, as Engadget editors rail against such oversights, we hope you'll be cruising along with this snappy Hummingbird 
processor, and capturing happy memories in 720p glory.</p>  <h2>Any carrier</h2> <h5>If you have poor impulse control...</h5> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/28/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-review/" target="_blank"><img id="vimage_4154789"

leap forward for smartphones with a bleeding-edge dual-core processor that's thrilling to command and a WVGA display that's quite simply jaw-dropping. If you can exercise a bit of patience, you'll likely
