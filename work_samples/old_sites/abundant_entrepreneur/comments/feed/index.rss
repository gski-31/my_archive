		<description><![CDATA[Hi Denis and Welcome!   Thanks for the kind worlds.  And it&#039;s great that you not only set your intention but that you declared it here. People sometimes miss how powerful that can be.  YOUR life on YOUR terms.  Great!  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sabrina, thank you for what you do, sharing your gifts!! I discovered you in the middle of last night while watching a video from my main man, Carl Harvey. Fantastic content! Looking forward to growing in the community. I really enjoy how you weave humor into your interviews. I have put out my intention to start an online business this year, and say &quot;bye bye 9-5&quot; once and for all, then truly live MY life on MY terms.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good reminders and techniques.  Thanks Lisa.  I agree that when you are comfortable with your message and material the nervous factor is reduced a lot.  You know you can handle any &#039;problem&#039; and keep moving forward.  Had to smile at not thinking of the audience in their undies.  That would distract me in an awful way !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful job Sabrina! I have a lovely friend who taught me all of this back in 1996 (read The Power of Oneness by Sandra Brossman Bezar). I completely manifested a new life and a new career. Now I am 60 and facing some physical challenges. And, it is time to manifest something new and different. The challenge has been clarifying what it is that I really want.
So, back to the drawing board. It is time to meditate and create some &quot;vision&quot; statements!
Thanks for your bright and refreshing perspective! You are perfectly Right On with what you are communicating!
I am sharing your information with my son and some other dear friends who are ready to manifest something new and beautiful in their lives!
I am looking forward to &quot;finding my passion&quot; once again!
Bless you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you. I understood why some photos are nicer than others. By the way, photographer only show your natural beauty because your photos are not &quot;photoshopped&quot;, are they?]]></description>
