				<p>As a heart-centered entrepreneur, whether you are launching a new business, or trying to make the quantum leap you know you are capable of, you have an incredibly powerful tool at your disposal that costs you nothing and is uniquely yours: your voice.</p>
<p>By using your experience, your expertise, and your voice to speak to groups, either large or small, you can build a solid foundation and kick-start your growth.</p>
<h4><strong>What Is Speaking?</strong></h4>
<p>Let’s get rid of a few misconceptions first.</p>
<div class="fusion-clearfix"></div>

			</div>
		</div><div  class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion_builder_column_3_5  fusion-three-fifth fusion-column-first 3_5"  style='margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:20px;width:58.4%; margin-right: 4%;'>
			<div class="fusion-column-wrapper" style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;"  data-bg-url="">
				<ul>
<li><em><em>First, we aren’t talking about The State of the Union or a Commencement Address here.</em></em></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Speaking does not have to be done in a formal or lavish setting for it to be effective. In fact, as an entrepreneur, expert, or business owner, you use your speaking skills in multiple contexts every day.The same speaking skills you use to convey your message to a small group gathered in your living room are the same ones you use in a conference room, creating a webinar, participating in a conference call, or up on stage in front of hundreds of attendees who have paid to hear your message.</p>

			</div>
		</div><div  class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion_builder_column_1_1  fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last 1_1"  style='margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;'>
			<div class="fusion-column-wrapper" style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;"  data-bg-url="">
				<ul>
<li><em>Second, contrary to what your fears are telling you, you don’t have to be an extrovert or love getting up in front of a crowd to speak.</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are a lot of tools you can use to make you feel more comfortable. You can effectively deliver your message in a video, a webinar, or over the phone. (Ladies, you don’t even have to do your hair for these ones!)</p>
<p>Remember, whenever you are talking about your business or your passion to a group that wants to hear what you have to say, you are SPEAKING.</p>
<h4><strong>Why Speak?</strong></h4>
<p>You have something to say that no one else can.</p>
<p>The combination of your experience, knowledge, and perspective is unique to you and the world is clamoring for people who can speak authentically to those experiences.</p>
<p>Here are 6 things that simply speaking can help you accomplish:</p>
<p><strong>1 &#8211; Boost your visibility</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By speaking you make yourself more visible to the world in a way that is more personal, accessible, and impactful than any writing or social media following you can create.</p>
<p><strong>2 &#8211; Boost your credibility</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When you are just starting out, you have the expertise to help your clients, but you lack the track record of successes and overjoyed customer testimonials that help convince people that you are the solution to their problems. When they see you speak they see you for who you are, an expert.</p>
<p><strong>3 &#8211; Boost your profitability</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Speaking is one of the cost effective ways you can add new business. You already have your ideas, experience, and voice. And for those of us who sometimes struggle with the technology side of thing (guilty!), speaking is perfect. You just need you, them, and a room.</p>
<p><strong>4 &#8211; Propel growth</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One of the quickest and best ways to grow your business quickly is to speak to as many potential customers as possible. By speaking you can turn audience members into customers and into referrals for other speaking engagements where you can turn more audience members into more customers and more referrals. Oh, Imagine the growth!</p>
<p><strong>5 &#8211; Leverage time</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The one thing you never have enough of as an entrepreneur is time. Speaking allows you to tell your story once and have it heard by as many people as can fit in the room. And if you’ve recorded your message, that same message can be seen and heard by the whole world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But the best part of speaking is that you don’t have to go out looking for prospective customers, because they are already there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In that 30 minutes or 1 hour, you have spoken directly to a group of people who wanted to hear what you have to say and are now ready to act. What’s a better use of your time than that?</p>
<p><strong>6 &#8211; Make Your Irresistible Offer</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What separates a conversation about your passion into an opportunity to sell your services to your engaged and interested audience is your offer. Your presentation should be a gateway to your offer.</p>

				<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When people hear your message and the passion you have for what you are offering right from your mouth, you can make your offer irresistible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But the best part of speaking is that you don’t have to go out looking for prospective customers, because they are already there.</p>

				<h4><strong>Make A Great Speech<br />
</strong></h4>
<p>How can you ensure that you’ve put together a great speech that is going to not only get people in the door, but have them leaving excited by your message?</p>
<p><em>1. Create a Great Talk Title</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your ability to deliver a great speech that turns into a sale starts with a Great Talk Title. Let your audience know not only what the talk is about, but how it will benefit them. The magic doesn’t happen at the end, but at the beginning and your Talk title begins to plant the seeds for your eventual success.</p>
<p><em>2. Create a Speaker Summary Sheet</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your summary sheet is a short biography of you, a summary of your talk (250 words, max! Keep it short), and your picture. This can be sent to organizations you want to speak to. You should also include a speaker introduction that the host can read when they are introducing you to the room.</p>
<p><em>3. Sizzle Reel</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your sizzle reel is a short video introducing yourself to your audience. It’s your trailer, press kit, speaker one-sheet, and bio … all wrapped into one powerful video. This is not something you need right away but keep your eye out for opportunities to catch this footage when you can.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Speaking from your heart always feels amazing. Speaking from your heart and actually turning that into sales feels even more amazing.</p>

				<p>Jerry Seinfeld has a joke about the fear of public speaking that goes like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“<em>I saw a study that said speaking in front of a crowd is the number one fear of the average person. Number two was death. This means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you would rather be in the casket than giving the eulogy.</em>”</p>
<p>If this sentiment applies to you, don’t worry. I have worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs and I can tell you with absolute certainty, <strong>you already have everything you need to overcome your fear of public speaking.</strong></p>
<p>The first thing I want you to know about public speaking is that it is not a unique talent. It is a skill that you can learn, and master with practice.</p>
<p>Think of the best speaker you’ve ever seen. They were not always that good. They struggled, they learned, they honed their craft. They become a great speaker. They weren’t born that way. In fact, when they were born, I can assure you they couldn’t speak at all.</p>
<p>If you truly want to overcome your fear of speaking, you can. And these tips will help you do it.</p>

				<h4><strong>Build Confidence By Controlling Your Environment</strong></h4>
<p>You don’t have to give your first speech as the commencement address at your Alma Mater or as the keynote speaker at a large conference. When you are talking about your business or your passion to a group that wants to hear what you have to say, you are SPEAKING.</p>
<p>This speaking can take place in your living room with five people, on a conference call, as part of a group meeting, or online through a webinar. Starting in one of these environments, whichever one makes you feel the most at ease, is a great first step to overcoming your fear.</p>

				<h4><strong>Imagination NOT required</strong></h4>
<p>Overcoming your fear of public speaking is not about convincing yourself of an alternate reality. You don’t need to picture the audience in their underwear or visualize yourself on stage as the confident speaker you one day will be.</p>
<p>Becoming a confident speaker is all about your message, and your message is already in you. It is your truth. But you convey so much more than your words when you are speaking. Your body language is key.</p>
<p>By learning and using body language that projects comfort and confidence to your audience, you can start to feel that confidence grow in you. Your confidence can come, at least in part, from the outside in.</p>

				<h4><strong>Prepare, prepare, prepare</strong></h4>
<p>I’m usually not one to use a sports analogy, but my marketing director told me that basketball coach Bob Knight once said, “<em>The key is not the will to win. Everybody has that. It’s the will to prepare to win that’s important.</em>”</p>
<p>And that seemed kind of perfect to me.</p>
<p>You see, the same is true of public speaking. Wanting to be a great public speaker isn’t enough. It’s really all about the preparation. But how do you prepare?</p>
<p>First, know your audience and craft your message to them. Speak in a way that is comfortable and natural for you, but in a language they can understand, and make sure you are addressing their needs and not just your own. If your message is clear and it resonates with them, you will feel that as you speak and it will make you more confident and comfortable.</p>
<p>Second, anticipate resistance and prepare to meet it. Find the most likely objections to your message and know how you are going to answer those objections.</p>
<p>Meeting obstacles you didn’t expect is nerve-wracking, but if you’ve anticipated the obstacle, encountering it can be comforting and reinforces your total mastery of what you are presenting.</p>
<p>Third, focus on how great your talk is, not how long your talk is. Everyone in your audience would prefer an excellent 45-minutes to a mediocre 90-minutes. They would also prefer an excellent 90-minutes to a mediocre 45-minutes. It’s not about the length, it’s about the quality. Every time.</p>
<p>In addition – and I can’t emphasize this enough – practice. Practice in front of a mirror, or on video, or with a colleague who can give you feedback. This can be really helpful in identifying all the ways you are communicating when you speak; your tone of voice, body language, facial expressions, hand gestures, &#8220;<em>ums</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>uhs</em>&#8220;, crutch words, or jargon.</p>
<p>All of these are more easily identified and improved upon with an outside point of view.</p>
<p>And finally, know your space. By arriving early and getting comfortable in the room you remove an unknown, which will make you feel much more at ease. Take some time in the room before the crowd arrives to just be in the space, to breathe in the space. This will help to prepare your body and mind since you’ve already prepared your presentation.</p>

				<h4><strong>Practice Self-Care</strong></h4>
<p>Taking the time to take care of yourself is crucial to both the health of your business and to your quality of life but it’s especially important for overcoming your fear of public speaking.</p>

				<p>It’s very hard to master something new when you are feeling tired, irritable, stressed, or forgetful. You’ve done the work of preparing your presentation. You are the expert in the room and are the only one who can deliver your message. Now take some time to relax and feel refreshed so you can do your best.</p>
<p>You’ve taken care of the work, now take care of you.</p>
<p>And after it’s done, take some time to reflect. Muscles are built in the rest time after the workout. The same is true for learning from what you’ve done. In quiet reflection after a presentation is when you learn the lessons of that experience.</p>

				<h4><strong>Be Yourself!</strong></h4>
<p>Remember that what you are offering when you speak is yourself. You are giving your audience the gift of your experience and perspective. They want the real you!</p>
<p>Which is great, since there’s no one else you’re more prepared to be. You’ve been you for a long time!</p>
<p>Bring your authentic self and let your personality shine through.</p>
<p>There are two ways that speakers tend to short-circuit their own authenticity:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>First, by trying to wing it.</em><br />
Gaining speaking confidence is all about being prepared and the more prepared you are to deliver the content of your speech, the more your true personality can shine through.</li>
<li><em>Second, by over-scripting what you’re going to say.</em><br />
The pendulum swings both ways – creating rigidity and over-scripting makes it easier to get thrown off if someone asks a question you were going to talk about later, or you understand that the room isn’t responding to something, or if the projector breaks or the mic goes out. Know your content and be comfortable with your delivery, but avoid getting locked into reading off a prepared script.</li>
</ol>

				<h4><strong>Prepare For Things To Go Wrong</strong></h4>
<p>Breathe.</p>
<p>Breathe again.</p>
<p>There. Good. If you speak long enough something will go wrong. It’s ok. It happens to all of us.</p>
<p>Take some time in your preparation to think through how you’ll respond if something doesn’t go as planned. If you’ve thought about it already it will be less of a surprise if it happens.</p>
<p>The important part isn’t that something went wrong, the important part is how you respond. Here are a few things you can do to master your response:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t take it personally.</strong> The laptop going out isn’t the will of the universe directed at your presentation. Keep cool. Breathe. You know what you’re going say and you know it’s worth hearing. This won’t derail you. You’ve got this!</li>
<li><strong>Find the humor in the situation.</strong> Your audience is going to feel bad for you when something goes wrong. They’ll tense up on your behalf. If you can relax into it, find the humor and keep it light, they will feed off your positive energy and you’ll all ride the storm out.</li>
<li><strong>Stick to your plan</strong>. You’ve prepared for this presentation. You know your stuff. You know it will work the way you’ve planned it. Do what you had already planned to do and you’ll be just fine.</li>

				<p>Recently, I had a photo shoot &#8211; to get some fresh current pictures for my websites.</p>
<p>The photographer was AMAZING (<em>very skilled and gifted</em>) and I’m thrilled with the shots.</p>
<p>But <em>The Best Thing</em> about the photo session was that he taught me a few very simple tips that anyone can use for taking excellent pictures and videos! (<em>even selfies!</em>)</p>
<p>And now I&#8217;m going to share them with you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  (<em>Wow! They make SUCH a difference! If you think you’re not photogenic –just wait &#8217;til you implement these tips.</em>)</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s for your website or marketing, or just family photos – remember these few important things next time someone pulls out a camera:</p>
<div class="fusion-clearfix"></div>

			</div>
		</div><div  class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion_builder_column_1_1  fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last 1_1"  style='margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;'>
			<div class="fusion-column-wrapper" style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;"  data-bg-url="">
				<h4><strong>1 &#8211; Lighting is EVERYTHING</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The type and location of the light can mean the difference in looking like a skin care model OR a zombie.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>A. Backlit Lighting</strong> – <span style="color: #ff0000;">Horrible! The biggest mistake everyone makes!</span><br />
Never shoot with a window or light BEHIND you. Regardless of how great the view is out the window – you’ll look dark faced and scary standing in front of it. Turn around and face the window for your shot (<em>and get close to the window&#8230;it might feel weird but it works</em>) and watch your wrinkles disappear!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> B. Overhead Lighting </strong>– <span style="color: #ff0000;">Horrible</span><br />
Light directly overhead is NOT good. It creates shadows and you’ll look tired. This goes for outdoor shots too – avoid “<em>noon</em>” when the sun is directly overhead. Mornings and dusk are Terrific times for outdoor shots (<em>always face the light.</em>)</p>

			<div class="fusion-column-wrapper" style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;"  data-bg-url="">
				<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>C. Front Lit</strong> – <span style="color: #008000;">Tada!</span> (You’ll look incredible&#8230; like, &#8220;<em>are you a super model?</em>&#8220;)<br />
Point the light directly at your face (<em>not so close that you get shiny with reflections.</em>) This works for video, photos, Skype, Facebook Live&#8230; get a light behind the camera and pointing at you (like the “<em>stand facing the window</em>” example above.)</p>
<h4><strong>2 &#8211; Camera Position<br />
</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Have the camera slightly above eye level&#8230; this helps with the neck looking smooth and keeps people from seeing up your nose.</p>
<h4><strong>3 &#8211; Where to Look</strong></h4>

				<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Look directly into the camera lens – this is especially tricky when on a mobile device.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You need to know exactly WHERE the eye of the camera is (<em>it’s often in a corner on a mobile device</em>) and look THERE. (<em>You wouldn’t want to look in the middle of your phone when taking a shot or you’ll look cross-eyed since the lens is in the corner.</em>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Of course with a NORMAL camera – just look right into the lens.</p>

				<h4><strong>4 &#8211; Check Your Background<br />

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Make sure you don&#8217;t get an incredible shot only to discover that a tree branch behind you looks like it’s sticking out of your head. Clear the clutter when possible.</p>
<h4><strong>5 &#8211; Genuine Smile<br />
</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">No one likes a grumpy-grump OR a fake plastic smile.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Think about your dog, your kids, that private joke you can’t tell anyone – and let your face genuinely smile. <em>RELAX</em> and then smile again&#8230;don’t hold a fixed smile because it’s unnatural.</p>

				<p>One thing that can be even more insidious than physical clutter is clutter of the <em>non-physical</em> variety.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?   Basically, <strong>clutter is anything that&#8217;s taking up space and serving no purpose in moving us or our lives forward</strong>.</p>
<p>Physical clutter is easy to see because it&#8217;s usually making a mess of the physical space around us. But what about our emotional space, our psychological space or our energetic space?</p>
<p>When we hold onto ideas, habits, feelings or beliefs that serve no useful purpose, they are just crowding our space, draining our energy and keeping us from moving forward.</p>

				<p>Maybe they used to work for you but it&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve outgrown. Or, maybe they NEVER served a useful purpose.  Like some Christmas present that you never used but didn&#8217;t want to throw away because of your love for the person that gave it to you.</p>
<p>Some ideas or beliefs are like that.  Maybe an idea that you got from your parents about your limitations, or what you &#8220;<em>should</em>&#8221; do. Even though it never really served to help move you forward, you never really got rid of either.</p>

				<p>To me, THAT&#8217;s the most important clutter to identify!   And sometimes it&#8217;s the hardest.</p>
<p>Because often belief clutter can dress itself up as &#8220;<em>good advice</em>&#8221; or as &#8220;<em>just being practical.</em>&#8221;  But unless it&#8217;s helping you move forward in your life now it&#8217;s, AT BEST, harmlessly weighing you down. And, AT WORST, actively keeping your from attaining your goals.</p>
<p>I can tell you that just like physical clutter, there can be a level of &#8220;<em>comfort</em>&#8221; &#8211; almost the feeling of a security blanket &#8211; from not throwing it out.  It&#8217;s familiar. It&#8217;s been there forever. And with the space it&#8217;s taking up, you don&#8217;t really have room for that new idea, that new project, that new risk that you&#8217;ve been considering.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a convenient excuse to say NO to that opportunity to move in a different direction.</p>
<p>But, trust me, like with any clutter, the faster you get rid of things that aren&#8217;t helping you, the faster and more successfully you can move forward.</p>
<p>Getting rid of clutter like that is like taking your foot off the brake. But it ALSO frees up that foot to step on the gas!</p>

				<p>Getting rid of clutter like that is like taking your foot off the brake. But it ALSO frees up that foot to step on the gas!</p>
<p>I CAN tell you that emotional, psychological or energetic clutter can be more slippery than physical clutter.  You may have to get rid of it over and over again.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s actually fantastic, right?   Because you don&#8217;t have to be as scared or as brave when you throw it away.</p>
<p>With physical clutter, usually if it goes in the trash, it&#8217;s gone out of your physical space. (If it&#8217;s actually a sign of clutter in your non-physical space, similar physical clutter might come right back &#8212; but the original item is gone.)</p>
<p>But with this less visible clutter, it can be harder to get rid of. It&#8217;s stickier. But it gives you the chance over and over again to really examine if it&#8217;s working for you and re-affirm over and over that you are choosing a different idea, belief, feeling or energetic practice.</p>
<p>One technique that I ran across for dealing with physical clutter is to identify areas where you tend to let clutter accumulate and put something beautiful or something that you LOVE there. As a replacement for the clutter.</p>
<p>I love that idea!   When you see something beautiful sitting in that space, then the idea of junking it up with something you don&#8217;t even really care about seems ridiculous!  It&#8217;s like setting up a clutter force-field!</p>
<p>So maybe try that with different thoughts, ideas and beliefs?   When you identify those things that aren&#8217;t working for you or are holding you back, try setting up a different belief in that space. Something that EXCITES you and makes you feel wonderful!</p>
<p>For instance, in modern times we have developed a real fear of failure &#8211; like no other time in our history.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like the expectation is that you have to be instantly the best at something in order to TRY it.</p>
<p>Maybe because things are so much more &#8216;<em>instant</em>&#8216; these days with the internet. Any failure might be instantly captured on our friends&#8217; phones and posted on <em>YouTube</em> or submitted to <em>America&#8217;s Funniest Videos</em>.  Whatever the reason, people have become scared of even trying something new. Or they&#8217;ll try it once and that&#8217;s it.</p>

				<p>But that&#8217;s not what businesses are built on. That&#8217;s not what this country was built on.</p>
<p>Thomas Edison tried one thing after another to make the incandescent light bulb a viable commercial product. But attempt after attempt was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>After thousands of &#8220;<em>failures</em>,&#8221; one of his associates was discouraged and Edison cheerily assured him that they now knew for a certainty that it couldn&#8217;t be done that way. Or any of the other thousands of ways that they&#8217;d tried so far. But this failed experiment moved them closer to their goal.</p>

				<p>WONDERFUL example of replacing useless mental clutter with something positive and encouraging!</p>
<p>So, rather than fearing failure, stop demanding instant success and see it as a process.Businesses, like everything else, are built on TRYING something, and if it doesn&#8217;t give us the results we want&#8230; trying something else.</p>
<p>So what about you?   Can you find examples of mental, emotional or limiting belief clutter in your own life?  Which type do you find the hardest to &#8220;<em>clean up?</em>&#8221;   Can you think of ways to replace it with something else? Something that can help you move forward?</p>

				<p><a href="http://abundantentrepreneur.com/that-sneaky-sneak-thief/">Last time</a>, I mentioned a sneaky thief that may be robbing your manifestation efforts and promised we&#8217;d go into more detail.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s time. Let&#8217;s talk about <strong>clutter</strong>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the physical clutter around you in your personal or work space.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;<em>My clutter is annoying, but how can it be affecting what I can manifest?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Try to start thinking of clutter as a sign of what&#8217;s going on inside of you &#8212; energetically.</p>
<p>Usually clutter is made up of 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Things that make you feel good. Things that you like. Things are things that you want to hang onto or take action on.</li>
<li>Things that you don&#8217;t make you feel good. These are things that need your attention &#8211; one day &#8211; but you &#8220;just don&#8217;t want to deal with them right now.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of those types of clutter are going to be working against you energetically.</p>

<p>If it makes you feel good or positive, then find a proper and respectful place to keep it &#8212; so you&#8217;ll know where to find it in the future.</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t make you feel good, the idea is to get rid of it. Maybe that means dealing with it immediately if it requires you to do something &#8212; and that&#8217;s fine. The less time it&#8217;s around you and draining your energy, the better.</p>

				<p>I find a large number of people reach out to me because they don’t even know where they want to begin. They aren’t sure what they want.</p>
<p>They KNOW they want MORE. But they aren’t sure what form that should take.</p>
<p>That’s actually a really common problem but there’s an easy first step to address the problem. I call it, <strong>The Empty Your Cup Solution</strong>.</p>
<p>Why do I call it that? Because the problem reminds me of a Zen parable:</p>

				<p>In our journey to manifest more abundance in our life, one of the easiest ways to provide the universe a delivery method to us, is to start taking steps to become an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>But <strong>one of the first things that we need to do</strong> (and something that we should do over and over again) <strong>is to make sure there is room in our cup</strong> for what we are co-creating with the universe.</p>
<p>At the beginning, we need to make room for the IDEAS, and then we need some elbow room to shuffle all those ideas and pick the one we want to use as a GOAL.</p>
<p>Then, after that, over and over as we start manifesting more and more &#8211; we need to open up the space that requires.</p>
<p>The biggest THIEF of your manifesting efforts is also the SNEAKIEST. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It’s CLUTTER!</span></strong></p>

				<p>I say that it’s sneaky because it’s so subtle and can get you in so many different ways <strong>without you even noticing that it’s happening</strong>…</p>

				<p>In the morning, I spend about 20-minutes catching up on email (making sure there are no emergencies) before I leave for my fitness class. This morning one email, in particular, jumped out at me.</p>
<p>It was a thank-you message from  ‘Rosemary’ (one of my clients). She was writing to excitedly share that the new idea we recently implemented into her business had boosted sales dramatically! And she’s planning a Christmas trip to see the Rockettes in NYC with her daughter to celebrate. (I LOVE hearing stories like this –so sweet!)</p>
<p>But as an aside she asked:</p>
<p><em>“This may sound like a silly question but would you please explain &#8211; What exactly is an &#8220;affiliate&#8221;?</em></p>
<p>So I thought I’d take a moment and define a few things you might hear when people are talking about a work-from-anywhere online business. (Yeah, even that’s too much.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s focus on basic terms you&#8217;ll hear from those using email marketing.</p>
<p>First, people use email for marketing to potential clients for one reason: <em>It works.</em></p>
<div class="fusion-clearfix"></div>

		</div><div  class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion_builder_column_2_5  fusion-two-fifth fusion-column-first 2_5"  style='margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:20px;width:37.6%; margin-right: 4%;'>
			<div class="fusion-column-wrapper" style="background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;"  data-bg-url="">
				<div class="imageframe-align-center"><span style="border:1px solid #000000;" class="fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-15 hover-type-none"><img src="http://abundantentrepreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/AE-workstation.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Abundant Entrepreneur - Your Workstation" title="Abundant Entrepreneur: Your Workstation" class="img-responsive wp-image-2456" srcset="http://abundantentrepreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/AE-workstation-200x200.jpg 200w, http://abundantentrepreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/AE-workstation.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 1240px" /></span></div><div class="fusion-clearfix"></div>

		</div><div  class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion_builder_column_3_5  fusion-three-fifth fusion-column-last 3_5"  style='margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:20px;width:58.4%'>
			<div class="fusion-column-wrapper" style="background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;"  data-bg-url="">
				<p>A recent study in the Harvard Business Review, found that <strong>an average person will spend up to 50% of their time at work in their inbox.</strong></p>
<p>So you know you&#8217;ve got an audience.</p>
<p>An email list is your &#8220;little black book&#8221; where you keep all of your contact information for those you have (or want) a business relationship with.</p>
<p>Whether they are prospective customers or actual customers, they’re the people that you feel have the potential to want to hear what you have to say.</p>
<div class="fusion-clearfix"></div>

		</div><div  class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion_builder_column_1_1  fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last 1_1"  style='margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:20px;'>

				<p>In any discussion around email marketing, you might need to be familiar with the following terms:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your List:</strong> All the names and email addresses that you have collected since you started.</li>
<li><strong>Lead or Prospect:</strong> A person that you have reason to believe may have an interest in you or your product</li>
<li><strong>Lead Magnet:</strong> An offer designed to attract those that might have an interest in you or your product. Usually this is something you offer for free, or for a low price, (perhaps even at a loss) to entice someone&#8217;s interest.</li>
<li><strong>Number of Clicks:</strong> The number of people that received your email and “<em>took action</em>” (ie. clicked on a link you sent them)</li>
<li><strong>Optin Page or Leadpage:</strong> This is a web page (or Facebook page) where you collect names and email addresses to add to your list</li>
<li><strong>Thank you page:</strong> Anyone submitting their contact info on an Optin Page will be sent to a Thank You page (thanking them and letting them know that the action they just took was successful.)</li>
<li><strong>Optins or Subscribers:</strong> These are the people that give you their name and email on an optin page (showing an interest in you or what you provide them)</li>
<li><strong>Autoresponder:</strong> This is a sequence of email messages that are automatically sent to subscribers (in whatever order and frequency you decide). For instance, when someone registers for a webinar, you could set an autoresponder email to go out to them immediately to let them know they are registered and give further instructions for how to attend.</li>
<li><strong>Segment or Bucket: </strong> These are the people on your list that you can identify as having a particular characteristic or interest.If your products are targeted to Working Women, but your optin page specifically deals with women who have children, then you can identify a segment or bucket of your list that you can further define as &#8220;<em>Working Women with Children</em>.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate:</strong> When you find someone that offers a product that is aligned with the interests of your customers, you can partner with that person to sell products and share the profits. Then you and that person are affiliates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing these 10 terms will definitely help you better understand the lingo being used to describe and chat about email marketing. And remember, there’re no silly questions, so please ask if there is ever a term that is new to you.</p>

				<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times someone has asked me&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #800080;">&#8220;<em>Do I really need to market my product? If it’s really good – won’t it sell itself?</em>&#8220;</span></strong></p>
<p>You’ve heard the saying: “<em>This product sells itself?</em>”</p>
<p>I’m sorry to disagree, but in my opinion – <strong>This is a myth.</strong> Nothing sells itself.</p>
<p>Sure &#8211; maybe if you get the right opportunity- in front of the right audience -at the right price&#8230; And at the right time &#8211; then, yeah, &#8220;<em>selling</em>&#8221; can seem effortless.</p>
<p>But there is  “<em>work</em>” involved before-hand in order to make that selling seem automatic.</p>
<p>Usually the work involved is simply to identify the perfect audience (aka CUSTOMER) for your message or product:</p>
<ul>
<li>These are the people (your potential buyers) that will be excited to hear about what you have to say.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re the  ones who are WAITING for just what you are offering (whether they are aware of it or not at the moment.)</li>
<li>These are the people who&#8230; as soon as you open your mouth and start talking&#8230; recognize that what you&#8217;re talking about is EXACTLY what they need in order to solve a problem they currently have.</li>
<li>They want to say – “<em>THANK YOU – it’s perfect to solve my problem.</em>”</li>

<li>Willing to pay what you are asking (they can afford it)</li>

				<p>The easiest way is to develop a profile for what someone in your perfect audience looks like. Allow that profile to become so real to you, they become a real person in your head.</p>
<p>Even give them a name.</p>
<p>And then every time you reach out &#8211; whether it&#8217;s an email or an advertisement &#8211; pretend you are talking directly to that person.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it!  So simple.  But you&#8217;ll be AMAZED how such a tiny shift in your thinking can completely change the way you talk to your audience and how laser-focused your messaging, marketing and advertising can become.</p>
<p>&#8212;&gt; Need a little help getting started on creating that profile?</p>

<ul>
<li>How do they spend their free time?</li>
<li>What kind of movies do they watch?</li>
<li>What kind of books or magazines do they read?</li>
<li>What kind of hobbies are they into?</li>

</ul>
<p>3 &#8211; But most importantly, you&#8217;ll want to ask the really deep question&#8230; who are they really?</p>
<ul>
<li>What are their values?</li>
<li>What are their struggles?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why do they get up in the morning?</li>
<li>What gives their life meaning?</li>
<li>What 3 attributes do they most value (in themselves and others)?</li>
<li>What are the secret challenges that keep them awake at night?</li>

				<p>First, Bentley (the oldest) wakes me up quietly, before his brother notices.<br />
Bentley is an alpha and likes to pretend he&#8217;s &#8220;too cool for school&#8221; and sometimes thinks it&#8217;s hilarious to plays aloof. But in the morning when it&#8217;s just  the two of us, he allows himself a tenderness that I&#8217;m not sure anyone else gets to see with him. He lays on his back, stretches his arms overhead, and “talks” with grumbling pleasure noises as I rub his belly.</p>

				<p>These little guys have taught me a very profound truth that has really helped in how I approach business opportunities.</p>
<p>Their little morning lesson for me COULD have come at a more convenient time for me. I mean, really, why is it necessary that it happens an hour or so before I HAVE to be up?</p>
<p>But with them, I&#8217;m VERY aware that this opportunity will not always be there. Their lifespan is so much shorter than ours.</p>
<p>And I absolutely want to <strong>take full advantage of the opportunity and cherish it while it&#8217;s available.</strong></p>
<p>So, oddly, when I read a quote by Ray Kroc (the Founder of McDonalds), I understood it on a really deep level.  He said:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;<em>A man must take advantage of any opportunity that comes along</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>In life and in business.</p>

				<p>Every opportunity that has opened for me has had a limited window to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>So, if you are blessed enough to RECOGNIZE an opportunity&#8230;</p>
<p>And if you FEEL HOPEFUL and POSITIVE and EXPANSIVE about it when you think about it&#8230;</p>
<p>SEIZE that moment!  Grab that brass ring&#8230; that window of opportunity&#8230; BEFORE it passes you by&#8230;</p>
<p>And go for it FULLY. Allowing yourself to REALLY ENJOY IT.</p>

				<p>Because even if it&#8217;s not &#8220;perfect&#8221; in the way you think it could be.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s happening RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re not missing it. You&#8217;re taking advantage of it.</p>
<p>No regrets!</p>
<p>Bentley and Winston taught me that. And continue to give me that lesson every morning.</p>
<p>A lesson that I may not have chosen, but I TREASURE.</p>

				<p>Everyone is looking for a good work-life balance, but it&#8217;s even more important if you&#8217;re looking to start a side-business where you have to juggle your job, your family&#8230; all your existing obligations&#8230; and now somehow find time for this new endeavor.</p>
<p>In this interview with Chris Cade, I get to ask him specifically about that. I also ask him, as single father, what impact he has seen that having a successful online business has had on his relationship with his son.</p>

				<p><strong>Sabrina: Hi everyone! This is Sabrina Truscott with Abundant Entrepreneur. Today I&#8217;m really excited to bring my super-good friend, Chris Cade, to meet you. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The reason that I really wanted Chris to share some of his insights with you, is that this man is so full of integrity and his family values. But also his commitment to being a dad and the way that he has been able to structure his business and time freedom around being a single full-time father. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris, every time i see you posting on Facebook, you&#8217;re at karate classes with your son; at acting classes;  picking him up from school&#8230; I just see that you have this amazing relationship. While at the same time, being an extremely successful Abundant Entrepreneur in the Spiritual / Personal Development space. So I&#8217;d love for you to share&#8230; </strong></p>
<p><strong>How are you able to do that? How do you have so much free time and still able to be the dad that you are?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well it started when I was in the corporate world. I was building this business as a part-time hobby, basically.  In the daytime, I&#8217;d do my full-time job. In the evening, I&#8217;d spend time with the family. And then after they went to bed, I would work on building my business.</p>
<p>And I started like that for a few years. Until finally, I said, &#8220;<em>Okay, I want to serve in a much larger way. This is important to me.</em>&#8221;  My heart was in it and I finally had enough courage and confidence. So I decided to delete the corporate world and build my business full time.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have all the answers. Honestly, I didn&#8217;t know how I was going to generate the income. But I knew I wanted to do this. And I knew I had about two years worth of runway with what I saved up from the corporate world&#8230; between my severance pay and what little income I had coming in through my business.</p>
<p>And then over time, the right resources came into play.  Working hard. I had to devote myself full-time to the business. And that let me down that path.</p>
<p>And eventually I became a single father. And that journey was probably the greatest challenge of being an entrepreneur. Because I had to find a work and life balance in a way that I never had before.</p>
<p>Before I could do all this work it was great to run and build my business. But then I reached a point where I couldn&#8217;t do that anymore. My son needed my attention in a way that felt important.</p>
<p>Yes, I could have gotten other people to take care of him. And do things to grow my business even further than I had. But what I wanted to do was to be there to take him to school.</p>
<p>So now, it&#8217;s really a lot of structure in the morning. I wake up at 6am.  I meditate. Then, his alarm goes off 30 minutes later and I get him up. Get him ready for school. Get him off to school. And then I work for a few hours while he&#8217;s gone. Do the most important tasks that I can.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot of time to mess around. But I do the things that make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: And the meditation probably helps you have that focus and productivity on what needs to be done, rather than all the other stuff we can find ourselves doing&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> And it grounds me as well, you know? Gives me that centering to start the day. And I find when I meditate in the morning, my days go much smoother. And when I don&#8217;t, there&#8217;s a little edge there.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: Absolutely. And about what you said a few minutes ago&#8230; being able to totally quit your full time business &#8212; I had a line of work and a job and did the same thing as you. Started to go online during those extra times until I was able to fully transition over. Which is just one way to do it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Right</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: But what were those first steps that you took when you were starting to try having an online business. What was that like? The first three steps for a newbie that&#8217;s trying to model what you did.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> First, you need to set the intention. Really. Set the intention. Because I wasn&#8217;t fully prepared for that.</p>
<p>I literally gave my employer a one-year notice.  It&#8217;s nice for them in the corporate world. They don&#8217;t need a year&#8217;s notice. But I needed a year&#8217;s notice. So that I could get myself emotionally aligned. Prepared. And also know that I&#8217;m going to be taken care of. And put that forth.</p>
<p>So it was that intention that didn&#8217;t just say, &#8220;<em>I want to do this.</em>&#8221; It says, &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m GOING to do this.</em>&#8221; And I made myself externally accountable.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: You said it out loud.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> To the person who I&#8217;m dependent on for my livelihood. Not just a random person.</p>
<p>Not to belittle a spouse or a family member. But when it&#8217;s close to the vest, it&#8217;s easier to have a little bit of failure going. To be, &#8220;<em>Well I didn&#8217;t go for it. It&#8217;s OK, it didn&#8217;t happen.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>But when I&#8217;m telling the person who&#8217;s cutting my paychecks that I&#8217;m going to leave. And I&#8217;m going to do it for this uncertain path (as it seems of entrepreneurship)&#8230; it&#8217;s cemented in me.</p>
<p>Like: &#8220;<em>This is real. This is not just an idea. It&#8217;s not just a hope, or a dream, or a want. This is GOING TO HAPPEN.</em>&#8221;  And i put it out there.</p>
<p>So the first step is absolutely to put the intention out there. And do it in a vocal way. Where you can be accountable for it. Even if it&#8217;s not leaving in two weeks or four weeks. Just say, &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m going to do this. Period.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: There&#8217;s something about speaking it. And writing it. I know that there have been times in my life that I kept those things to myself because if I didn&#8217;t do them&#8230; well, I didn&#8217;t want to look bad. And I practice more and more&#8230; saying, &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m going to do this. I&#8217;m going to try it. I&#8217;m interested in this.</em>&#8221; Don&#8217;t be afraid to to shout it out. Because the universe is listening.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: And if we&#8217;re not saying that, then maybe we&#8217;re saying the other. You know, we&#8217;re always saying something.  We can&#8217;t be quiet even if we want to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Inaction is saying that we&#8217;re satisfied with the status quo. That we&#8217;ll stay comfortable in whatever limitation we have. In whatever fear we have. We&#8217;ll stay there if we stay quiet.</p>
<p>So the second thing, is to actually find mentors. Find people who have done it before. This is one thing my dad taught me when I was young. He would teach me how to set goals. And he would say,&#8221;<em>Whatever goal you want&#8230; set the goal, map it out</em>&#8221; &#8212; and then he would say, &#8220;<em>If there&#8217;s anything I can do to help you get there then I&#8217;ll do it</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: What a good dad!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Oh, he was amazing. He would make me do the work. But if there&#8217;s a genuine blockage that I, as a ten-year-old, couldn&#8217;t complete&#8230; then he would try and clear that for me so that I could keep going.</p>
<p>And he always said, &#8220;<em>Find people that have done what you want to do, and study with them. And tour with them. And if you can&#8217;t do that, hire them</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Find a way to have the best of the best on your team to do what you want.  And that&#8217;s what I did all throughout my life. That&#8217;s why I have so many successes.</p>
<p>And when I went to the online world&#8230; again&#8230;  I was consuming programs, audiobooks&#8230; but the biggest thing that made a difference for me?  You know, I had the ten dollar audiobooks and ebooks that I&#8217;d buy and they&#8217;d absolutely help me &#8212; point me in the right direction and help change my mindset.  But it was when I put my money where my mouth was and invested in Jeff Walker&#8217;s product launch formula &#8211; a two thousand dollar product. I remember I couldn&#8217;t sleep the night before I was so nervous&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: Nervous about buying it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> About buying it!  I know I&#8217;m supposed to. But I can&#8217;t&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to do this. And I talked to my wife at the time and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;<em>You&#8217;ve got to do this. This is what you&#8217;re supposed to do.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>But I was so scared. For so many reasons.One reason was that I&#8217;d never spent that much on anything.  I mean, that&#8217;s like half of a car for some people. And a cheap car, no less. That&#8217;s like 3 or 4 months of rent depending on where you live. That&#8217;s not a small chunk of change.</p>
<p>And so even though I was successful in the corporate world, that was a large chunk of my salary.  I was scared &#8211; financially. But I was also scared &#8212; and I didn&#8217;t see this until later&#8230; deep down &#8212; &#8220;<em>What if I succeed? What if I change this life that I&#8217;m living?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what a life of entrepreneurship could, or would, look like. I knew the comfort, safety and the limitations of the corporate job I had. And even though it&#8217;s comfortable and safe&#8230; that&#8217;s what brought in some uncertainty about doing this. But I knew I had to. So overnight, I couldn&#8217;t sleep, couldn&#8217;t sleep&#8230; but as soon as the buy button was available, I was in. I didn&#8217;t want to watch any sales videos. I didn&#8217;t have to read the page. I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m buying that right now.&#8221;  And I got it. And I implemented it.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: You took action. First, you said it out loud. and then you took a big action.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Right. Exactly. And specifically found mentors. I think that&#8217;s key. Because if we&#8217;re taking the wrong actions, it&#8217;s useless. No matter how divinely guided we are &#8212; if the Divine is saying, &#8220;<em>Here&#8217;s the action to take.</em>&#8221; And we&#8217;re like, &#8220;<em>Oh, no. You don&#8217;t know. Let me do it this other way on my own.</em>&#8221; Then we&#8217;re not accepting that support.  Similarly, with programs and resources and coaches and mentors&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It&#8217;s so imperative that we find that people who have walked the path we want to walk.  And follow them.</em></p>

				<p><strong> Sabrina: Yeah. You and I actually met at a mastermind with our peers and mentors. It was at Glen and Natalie Ledwell&#8217;s event, in 2010.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah that&#8217;s right. And if it weren&#8217;t for that, we would not be here talking today.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: Honestly, most of my really best friends &#8212; that I feel understand my heart and my passion; and the way that I want to connect with my customers, with my clients; the way I truly want to teach and share &#8212; I have met in this community. There is such a support in the online world of people who want to share their passion. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris, one thing I really love and respect about you (one of the many things) is the way that you value your clients, your students, your customers. The way you speak of them with with such respect. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What do you get out of that and what does that mean for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> First of all, I refer to them as my audience. Because that&#8217;s the best description I can use. A lot of people say &#8220;<em>my list</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>my subscribers</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>my clients</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>my customers</em>&#8220;, but I say audience because I think what I&#8217;m doing is&#8230; I&#8217;m sharing myself and sharing what I&#8217;ve learned along the journey. And they&#8217;re the people who witness that. And that&#8217;s what I think of in terms of an audience.</p>
<p>So these are the people that are on the journey with me. And I think it&#8217;s easy to get lost in thinking that either the teachers are gurus and super powerful and we could never be that, and who am I to teach?  Or you can go the other way and just try and stay quiet and hide. And not let our light shine.</p>
<p>So for me, it&#8217;s that balance of seeing that these are people who I&#8217;m serving and who have walked paths. Important paths. They may not have walked my path, but they&#8217;re walking a path that resonates with mine. And I have something to share with them about my path. But they also have things to share about their paths with me.</p>
<p>I get emails all the time from people sharing their stories, and what they&#8217;re grateful for. What they&#8217;ve learned. When I share about my life, they have insights for me from their own experience.</p>
<p>When I was going through a really painful time in my life,  I wrote about it.  I said, &#8220;<em>Look I&#8217;m going through a difficult time and I need support.</em>&#8221; And those people in my audience, they wrote back to me and said, &#8220;<em>We&#8217;ve got your back. We care about you. Thank you. We support you.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Those who had things like energy healing, they would do that for me. Even when I wasn&#8217;t there. They would say, &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m just going to send it to you at five o&#8217;clock on Thursday.</em>&#8221; Or whenever it was.</p>
<p>And that outpouring of love back to me, is just evidence of why I love what I do. Because it&#8217;s about touching people and making a difference. And knowing that I&#8217;ve touched people in such a way that they want to have that ripple effect and give it out.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s to me or other people.</p>
<p>I still remember this one story&#8230; I had a spiritual stories website (I still have it) and this one woman wrote to me and she said, &#8220;<em>I was in church the other day. And I&#8217;ve been trying to introduce my daughter to spirituality and share your stories with her, and she just wasn&#8217;t interested. But I was in church the other day and my daughter comes up with a story that was from your website that another person in the congregation had given her.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>So there is this other expanded circulation.</p>
<p>Another woman would print things out and send them to people in prison because her son was in prison and he couldn&#8217;t have access any other way.</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s stories like that that really remind me the &#8220;<em>why</em>&#8221; of what I do. Because it&#8217;s not just about this person in front of me. There is a ripple effect that when I change you&#8230; you change everyone around you.</p>
<p>And so that lights me up and keeps me going. Those stories&#8230; I love them. And one thing I find important in my journey is to always be touching bases with my audience. With the people who read my emails.</p>
<p>Even though i have an assistant who helps me&#8230; I still log in several times a week and just read those emails. See how people are responding. See what they&#8217;re connecting with. And reply myself.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: Well, that makes such a deeper relationship and connection with you. And that to me is also very rewarding. </strong></p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re just at a corporation and you&#8217;re doing your job like you did before&#8230;  you know that the product, or service, of the corporation is touching people. But when when you have your own online business (or your own products) and they&#8217;re actually speaking back to you&#8230; They might be your Facebook friends&#8230; the point is that we&#8217;re just real people and they&#8217;re just real people. </strong></p>
<p><strong>And I think the greatest thing is&#8230; as we both love to experience, we&#8217;re all one. There&#8217;s only this one-ness. So when I help you. You help me. And we help everyone. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I love that every single person is so uniquely them. And their message and their words can never come thru anyone else. </strong></p>
<p><strong>So everyone has something to share, and what you have to share that you think is just, &#8220;<em>Oh, everyone knows that.</em>&#8221; No, they might not. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Someone may need to hear exactly what you have to share in the way that you share it. And that&#8217;s what I love about everyone in this online community is that they are sharing their messages in their own unique ways and it&#8217;s not perfect. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s that raw tangible inspiring message rather than the raw reality TV show.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> (laughing) Where the messages are edited and refined.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: Yeah.  So that was a lot of great tips for how somebody can get started online and what you think the most three important things are you. Can you recap those three things for us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris: </strong> Yes. So, the first was to just set the intention. Be clear and get that intention out into the world.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: Speak it!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yes, speak it. It&#8217;s not just setting the intention but you&#8217;re gonna speak the intention.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: Speak, Say, or Write.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> And to someone who is accountable &#8211;  instead of just your close circle. Be a little more vocal about it.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina: Like if you&#8217;re having dinner and the waiter comes over, you say, &#8220;<em>I&#8217;d like a coke. And I&#8217;m going to be an Abundant Entrepreneur.</em>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> You know&#8230; even though we&#8217;re joking about it&#8230; that would be awesome!</p>
<p>Because it puts that energy out and it makes it a little more playful. Which allows the aliveness to come forth. And then the energy to move. It&#8217;s not just this stuck, serious thing&#8230; &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m going to be an Abundant Entrepreneur</em>.&#8221; You know? It really has some aliveness to it.</p>
<p>So, yes. Speak it out loud. And speak it frequently. I mean, it&#8217;s a great thing when you actually are really programming your brain to go for it.</p>
<p>The second thing is to get a good mentor (or several mentors.)  Find people who have done what you want to do and can take you there. Who can coach you. Who will watch you. Even if it&#8217;s a digital product that you buy &#8212; find someone who knows the path. And has mapped it out so that you can do that.</p>

				<p>And then the third step is to actually do it. Right?  It does no good to speak the intention and get the mentors if you&#8217;re not going to do what they say and walk that path. Because if you do those three things, the universe (as Paulo Coelho says) will conspire in your favor. It always does.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you the number of magical synchronicities that happened in my life as soon as I said, &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m going to do this.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>The right resources came in, the right products, programs, mentors&#8230; I mean, it&#8217;s been magic.  People like you walk into my life (laughing).   We wouldn&#8217;t be here now if it weren&#8217;t for me setting that intention, speaking it out loud, finding mentors and then taking action.</p>
<p>So, those are the three steps.</p>

<p><strong>Well,  thank you, Chris, for taking the time to come and chat and help inspire al of those Abundant Entrepreneurs out there. </strong></p>
<p><strong>And I&#8217;d like to end this interview with a quote that I think you&#8217;ll really love by our good friend Joe Vitali.  Joe likes to say that, &#8220;<em>A good goal will scare you a little and inspire you a lot.</em>&#8221; </strong></p>
<p><strong>So I hope this video has inspired you. And until next time,  and until next time&#8230; Be Abundant.</strong></p>

				<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">[Taking A Moment To Reflect]</span></p>
<p>I love that I was talking to Chris about how he managed to create a thriving online business while working a full time job and raising a child and he quotes his dad to me. Clearly his family and his own sense of contribution and growth are really important to him so I loved hearing how he juggles all of the demands on his time.</p>

				<p>Even though we all know we want to be &#8220;working our passion,&#8221; it&#8217;s not always practical for us to bundle EVERYTHING that we&#8217;re passionate about into our work experience. Some people have.. no doubt.</p>
<p>Some of my friends have built their whole business around their family life and that&#8217;s fantastic. But even if there are some passions that we have to reserve for our &#8220;off hours&#8221; it&#8217;s important to make sure that we allow time for them.</p>
<p>Whatever that entails.</p>
<p>Sometimes it means added organization or scheduling. Sometimes it&#8217;s joining a club or signing up for an extracurricular activity to force us to make that time. But it&#8217;s an individual and unique journey. It&#8217;s all about finding what works for you!</p>
<p>I wonder why it&#8217;s so much harder for us to take the time to take care of ourselves?  When it comes to taking care of others, we&#8217;re on top of it. But when it&#8217;s us, we&#8217;ll let our own hopes and dreams slip by&#8230;</p>
<p>How about you? Are you able to enjoy all of your passions through your work?  If not, how do you make sure that you make time in your day for them? Do you have any tricks that you use to make sure you don&#8217;t procrastinate with that?</p>
