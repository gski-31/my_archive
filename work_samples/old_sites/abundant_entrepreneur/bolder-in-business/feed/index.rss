Thanks for the backup and the forward push to do so.  Confidence is the best push to do anything.  Reminders can also do that.  You have done both.  Thank you much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Exactly, Dionne. What we go through shapes us.  The most interesting things people have to share (and what they feel the most growth from) are those points along the path when they met challenges and took the opportunity to let it clarify for them who they wanted to be. :) Seeing it is half the battle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve spent a long time fighting self limiting beliefs, but I&#039;ve always known that I&#039;m destined for bigger things and I felt quite tearful earlier that although it&#039;s taken me so long to get here and learn everything that I have learned, I&#039;ve been on this journey for a reason and it&#039;s made me who I am now. Over the last few months I&#039;ve received so much knowledge and help to be more confident in myself and I know that once the success hits, it will hit big time!  Thank you Sabrina xx]]></description>
