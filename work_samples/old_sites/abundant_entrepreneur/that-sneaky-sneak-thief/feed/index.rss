		<description><![CDATA[Disaster piles!  LOL.  It&#039;s insidious isn&#039;t it?  Just remember, bite size chunks.  Don&#039;t stress, Virginia. And maybe re-frame from disaster piles to &quot;treasure hunt piles.&quot;  You never know what they&#039;re going to open up for you ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my - are you peeking at my paperwork disaster piles?  (grin)
I start and let myself get distracted by doing a more &#039;enjoyable&#039; project (which can be anything) rather than clean up.
Thanks for the reminder to de-clutter.  
I&#039;m putting off bigger projects by stating &quot;I have to do this clean up&quot; but not doing it.]]></description>
