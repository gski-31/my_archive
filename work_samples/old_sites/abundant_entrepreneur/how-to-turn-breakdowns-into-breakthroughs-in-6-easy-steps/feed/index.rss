		<description><![CDATA[Hi Aspasia!  Some trauma survivors (and those struggling with PTSD) have told me they benefited from a meditation or relaxation practice first. A guided meditation for progressive muscle relaxation especially seems to encourage a relaxation and release of those tensions for them. Then, with the feeling of safety that comes with practice, the feeling of relaxation and safety that is associated with the therapist they are working with; or their current environment; or even sometimes, it&#039;s simply the voice of their &quot;guide&quot;... seems to help them allow that relaxation as they move on to other visualization and relaxation techniques.  I&#039;m not a therapist so I can&#039;t offer specific guidance to you in this area but if there is one suggestion from feedback I&#039;ve gotten myself, it&#039;s that.  Start there.  I&#039;m sorry that you have this additional challenge, but please realize that you&#039;re not alone. There are others &quot;working with&quot; and overcoming this situation out there. It&#039;s important that you know it&#039;s possible.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More of a ? really. I am a trauma survivor and have my &quot;agency&quot; all messed up. How do I have an intention when this goes against the way my brain works and I&#039;m not familiar at all with how to do this? When I think about what I want or need I draw a blank. This comes from the inescapable horror part of being an abused child. Any suggestions? Great article! Thanks]]></description>
