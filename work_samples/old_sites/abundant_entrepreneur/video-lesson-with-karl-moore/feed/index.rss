		<description><![CDATA[My heart goes out to you Audreyanne and your amazing example of strength through the worse kinds of adversity. But it seems that your approach to self-healing matches my own... reaching out a hand to help steady others. Giving. Even when you think you have nothing left. I don&#039;t feel that we&#039;re given more than we can handle. But sometimes it&#039;s amazing how very strong the universe thinks we are. Please know that our thoughts are with you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the past few years,  I lost my dad, brother, son and my mom within 4 1/2 years. I&#039;ve also been fighting 7 autoimmune diseases. When these things happened, I stepped back while my faith helped me thru the journey of grief. And accepting the fact that I couldn&#039;t do many things physically. (I also was hit by hurricane Sandy, and accepted the loss of all my material things) But, was Blessed by meeting many Angels on this earth. And I reached the point where I was now able to show love and support parents who recently lost a child! Then BAM, in short: my husband violently took his life. My young son found his Dad. It was and is horrific. Although I&#039;m leaving a lot out. My goal was to get my son to smile again. I reached out with my heart to everyone and anyone. People who I have loved, supported, and happily put first for most of my life. We are avoided. We are treated as if I were the Grimm Reaper. I continued to be me. I still mail cards just because, write letters, made calls always starting with: Hi, how are you? Wow, that&#039;s beautiful, or I&#039;m sorry to hear that, how c a n I help? Etc..... I can&#039;t let go of the belief that if I&#039;m kind, and show love, goodness will follow... I don&#039;t cry to anyone, I don&#039;t talk about heartache etc.... I always try to st a y positive, for the most beautiful sound to me is someone&#039;s laughter......Especially a child..... where do I go from here, I&#039;m losing strength]]></description>
