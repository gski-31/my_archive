		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful job Sabrina! I have a lovely friend who taught me all of this back in 1996 (read The Power of Oneness by Sandra Brossman Bezar). I completely manifested a new life and a new career. Now I am 60 and facing some physical challenges. And, it is time to manifest something new and different. The challenge has been clarifying what it is that I really want.
So, back to the drawing board. It is time to meditate and create some &quot;vision&quot; statements!
Thanks for your bright and refreshing perspective! You are perfectly Right On with what you are communicating!
I am sharing your information with my son and some other dear friends who are ready to manifest something new and beautiful in their lives!
I am looking forward to &quot;finding my passion&quot; once again!
Bless you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi sabrina. I liked your diction so clear for a Mexican woman to follow.  On the way to be retired, and planning what I want to do in this new stage of my life, you are right ,, body changes like itching you sAid. I had not made the connection of the this change with being sleepy and tired. With your explanation, I really got clarity.!!! I think I am in the right way, before the change happens, I started visualizing how happy and satisfied I will be doing something different.  Again you are right, the second steps demands courage, which I prefer to work now that I still have a job, than wait. I decided to start dancing lessons now, to help my body with this change ahead in February. 
Blessings and continuous evolution for you and your community in 2017!]]></description>
