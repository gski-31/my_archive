		<description><![CDATA[Hi Denis and Welcome!   Thanks for the kind worlds.  And it&#039;s great that you not only set your intention but that you declared it here. People sometimes miss how powerful that can be.  YOUR life on YOUR terms.  Great!  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sabrina, thank you for what you do, sharing your gifts!! I discovered you in the middle of last night while watching a video from my main man, Carl Harvey. Fantastic content! Looking forward to growing in the community. I really enjoy how you weave humor into your interviews. I have put out my intention to start an online business this year, and say &quot;bye bye 9-5&quot; once and for all, then truly live MY life on MY terms.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So glad it resonated with you Albina!   Just continue to let yourself be open and take moments to Listen.  Also, if nothing is currently exciting you, take opportunities to try new things. I even do that myself. I allocate a certain amount of time and resources each month to learning something new or trying something different. I&#039;ve had some amazing opportunities present themselves by doing that! And it seems less overwhelming when you think in short time intervals rather than &#039;what do i want to do with my life&#039; :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow! It feels amazing when I read your comment Sabrina about help yourself first- the airplane example:) I&#039;ve been telling it to people I care for a long time. However I hardly apply it to myself. It seems I can&#039;t break the rat race n build something I&#039;d be exited about
All those quiet moments with myself do not bring the answers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sarah!  Lovely to hear from you.  We try to always provide inspiration and ideas with an eye toward implementing what you CAN, now.  Maybe on an extremely low budget, you can start by using Facebook to post more content around your area of passion -- to get more fans (who will one day convert to customers.)  Or, if you have a blog, make a point to regularly post blog material.  Both of these approaches are relatively free and a great way to start becoming known as an expert in your field.  Mainly, the idea is to start where you are, and move out from there.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very good video and nice to virtually meet you Sabrina, great interview with Steve by the way.

I follow Steve and his work, and his products are very good. I wish he would talk more about the business back end stuff to do with success. I have been looking into the whole Internet marketing thing and it is huge, vast and mind-blowing. For one person with no budget, I am struggling even though I know my passion and want to help others. There are plenty of gurus who will sell you courses on this or that way to do it but right now I wish I had a virtual marketer who could work with me to sort it all out, or clone myself 4 times over so I could do everything myself.

The mindset stuff is one piece but the marketing and business sides are a whole different ball game to a one woman band with no real budget, just passion. Any tips?]]></description>
