		<description><![CDATA[Awesome, Karin!  Congrats on making that mental shift. Side income, main income, I try to share things that will help people be more abundant and happy - no matter how they want to approach it. :)  So glad to have you be part of the conversation!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting this! It is motivating! I&#039;m trapped in a dead-end job and looking to make a good side income, and I learned entrepreneurship. That is definitely a big change for me, and it was quite a journey out of my comfort zone. I recently launched an e-store on Shopify and also own two blogging sites which I have affiliate links, so I am learning affiliate marketing as well.

There are times I felt like &quot;I&#039;ve fallen and I can&#039;t get up!&quot; but your trainings will help me get back up :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This video was great! Sonia Ricotti is super inspiring. Thanks so much for it Sabrina.

I recently did a Digital Marketing course, and my certification is recognized worldwide. For me, it&#039;s the perfect time to set up a website and doing Youtube videos because I have the skills and the knowledge required for these two online platforms. But the problem is, about what? I don&#039;t have clear ideas about what to talk aboutin my videos and website.

Kind regards,

Andrea]]></description>
