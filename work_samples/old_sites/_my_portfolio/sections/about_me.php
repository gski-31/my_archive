            <p>I’m an adaptable and competent Web Developer. I have professional experience designing and developing responsive websites from scratch utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a little PHP. I have a solid track record of completing projects successfully and on time. I absolutely love to code and the fulfillment that planning and hands on implementation bring. I also possess a very strong graphics background and a firm grasp on current email marketing techniques and standards.</p>
            <p>I’ve recently relocated to Glendale, CA and am actively seeking a junior to mid-level role. While searching, I’m also enhancing my skill-set by participating in online training courses in Front End Development and The JavaScript Stack.</p>
