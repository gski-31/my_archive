If I call & need some extra help or attention with one of my clients, HE’S ON IT!!

He asks the right questions and communicates well on each and every project he works on. He makes changes quickly and follows directions. With such minimal instruction I am consistently amazed at the quality of product he produces. He has been a pleasure to work with and I will miss him dearly. Any organization would be lucky to have him as an employee. I highly recommend Jason </blockquote>

                <blockquote> Jason Gralinksi always handled my requests in a timely manor and with great efficiency. My job was to come up with the ad copy, but I was horrible with layout and imagery. Often just saying- "read what I wrote, and add something like it sounds please", and he would! Every time! His creativity and the cleanliness of his pieces really shined through every time. Even more so, every time I had an emergency request (usually not my fault, but not always) he would always take care of it! Even if it meant working longer hours to facilitate my clients needs. He made me and all of our staff look good on a consistent basis and I cannot thank him enough. I literally won accounts and made money I otherwise would not have due to his work and examples I was able to show. True professional and I am fortunate to have worked with him. </blockquote>
