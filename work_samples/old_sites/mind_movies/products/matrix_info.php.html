					<p>You already <strong><em>KNOW</em></strong> that the answers and the strength to achieve your goals, and triumph over your challenges...</p>

					<p>Are already <strong>inside you.</strong></p>

					<p>And yet for some reason, this inner power either doesn't come to you often enough; only appearing in flashes if you're lucky...</p>

					<p>In the cases of Delta or Theta brainwave-focused entrainment, it's even possible to re-enter that same receptive state of your infancy and childhood, and absorb new information like a sponge.</p>

					<p>After hours of poring over all this information, Morry and I realized what we must do:</p>

					<p>Here's how it works:</p>

					<p>First, the brainwave entrainment stimulates your brain's neuro-chemicals to bring you into an optimal state of <strong>CLARITY</strong> and <strong>OPENNESS</strong>; where resistance, stress and negativity can no longer touch you.</p>

					<p>Then, once your mind is in this optimal state of allowing, the Mind Movies visualization is free to penetrate <strong>DEEP</strong> into your subconscious and stay there, giving you instant, powerful and lasting personal transformation.</p>

					<p>As we started experimenting using this new blend of technology for just <strong><em>a few minutes a day,</em></strong> both on ourselves and our students...</p>

					<p>Just 9 years ago, Natalie Ledwell and her partner Glen launched Mind Movies as a way to share their video-making software with fellow Law of Attraction enthusiasts. Today Mind Movies has grown into a global human potential movement, with multiple peak performance tools powered by space-age mind science technology, and over 2.1 million students worldwide. Our next goal is to touch 10 million lives, and we believe partnering with luminaries like Morry Zelcovitch will help us get there.</p>

					<p>Mind Movies Matrix is more than just a training course to us - it's a movement.

					<p>In fact, we believe that if we can get this technology out to enough people... </p>

					<p>Everyone from schools to corporations to entire industries will use it to groom better students; better employees, entrepreneurs and inventors; and better leaders, visionaries, and thinkers.</p>

					<p>And what happens when all these people start waking up to what they're really capable of?</p>

					<div class="spacer"></div>

					<h2 class="text-center text-dark-cyan text-normal">Our <strong>planet</strong> wakes up too!</h2>

					<div class="spacer"></div>

					<p>That's why even though we've spent years of our time and hundreds of thousands of R&amp;D dollars... </p>

					<p>Our goal is to make Mind Movies Matrix as accessible as possible to as many people as possible.</p>

					<p>And so even though we could <em>easily</em> charge at least $3,000 for the Mind Movies Matrix system, and sell it as a premium training curriculum to those who can afford it...</p>

					<p>We're not going to.</p>

					<p>In fact the Mind Movies Matrix system won't even cost you four figures.</p>

					<p>Neither is it $800, or $600, or even $400.</p>

					<div class="spacer"></div>
					<div class="spacer"></div>
					<p class="text-italic">Science is more my thing, writing not so much!</p>

					<p class="text-italic">Nevertheless I am humbled by your interest in our technology - and after all those years in labs, libraries, sound studios and focus groups, I can't wait to show you what we've created.</p>

					<p class="text-italic">When you start experiencing the benefits of Mind Movies Matrix, which could be in a few days or weeks after starting to use it, you'll realize just how special it is.</p>

					<p class="text-italic">This isn't the kind of surface level personal growth that gives you a temporary high with little to show for it in the long run.</p>

					<p class="text-italic">Instead, Matrix is about triggering <strong>deep</strong> transformations in your brain's operating system.</p>

					<p class="text-italic">It's about upgrading the thoughts, emotions and habits that come to you on autopilot. </p>

					<p class="text-italic">It's about making you a better decision maker, problem solver and manifestor.</p>

					<p class="text-italic">And it's about empowering your brain to 'wake up' and start creating the life you want, instead of just letting life happen to you.</p>

					<p class="text-italic">The beauty of Matrix is that all these benefits happen with no conscious effort on your part...</p>

					<p class="text-italic">And that includes the time it takes to start enjoying them.</p>

					<p class="text-italic">You see as busy entrepreneurs and researchers ourselves, one of our biggest objectives was to make Matrix so quick and simple, even someone as busy as the President of the United States could still use it daily.</p>

					<p class="text-italic">So as we developed Matrix, Natalie and I stuck a sign on the wall that said 'UNDER 10 MINUTES A DAY'... and we successfully brought it down to just 6!</p>

					<p class="text-italic">All things considered, our promise to you is straightforward:</p>

					<p class="text-italic">When you give Mind Movies Matrix just <strong>6 minutes a day</strong>, it will reward you with <strong>deep</strong> and <strong>profound</strong> personal transformation... all on <strong>autopilot</strong>! </p>

					<p class="text-italic">In other words, we've already done the hard work...</p>

					<p class="text-italic">And all you need to do now is press PLAY.</p>

					<div class="spacer"></div>
					<div class="spacer"></div>


					<p class="text-italic">Esmée's original goal with Mind Movies Matrix was to focus on manifesting more money into her life, but her intuition quickly advised her otherwise.</p>

					<p class="text-italic">"I first needed to get some blocking thought patterns out of the way with regards to <strong>relationships</strong>," she explains, "...as they were inextricably interlaced with my unconscious beliefs about money and success." </p>

					<p class="text-italic">Within five weeks of using the Perfect Partner set for just a few minutes a day, Esmée came face-to-face with the impossible:</p>

					<p class="text-italic">"I had more or less given up hope to ever meet somebody worthwhile, and I have ample experience with relationships," said Esmée.  "But this man was really something else."</p>

					<p class="text-italic">"This wonderful man and I, we’re one of a kind - there are no insecurities, no doubts, just this feeling of finally coming home.</p>

					<p class="text-italic">We think along the same lines, we share the same values, we know what the other is thinking... I see his soul and he sees mine - and this is the first time I know I am being loved for being myself, imperfections and all. Even my 6-year-old son has been in love with this man from day one."</p>

					<p class="text-italic">Now that Esmée has got her relationship base covered, she's moving onto the Manifesting Wealth &amp; Achievement set!</p>

					<div class="spacer"></div>
					<div class="spacer"></div>

					<p>You probably know that famous movie with the same name as our mind optimization technology...</p>

					<p>One of my favorite lines from <em>The Matrix</em> is when our hero Neo's mentor, Morpheus, reminds him of the uncomfortable truth about knowledge.</p>

					<p>He says, with that trademark zen look on his face:</p>

					<p><em>"There is a difference between knowing the path... and walking the path."</em></p>

					<p>Now that you've come this far, you already know how easy it is to retune yourself for greater achievement, affluence and well-being.</p>

					<p>But will you choose to walk down this path?</p>

					<p>Will you take the red pill... harness Matrix's remarkable technology... and <strong><em>wake up</em></strong> to who you really are, and what you're really capable of?</p>

					<p>Or will you choose to go back to sleep, and do your best to block out the thousands of "what ifs?" from your thoughts?</p>

					<p>I believe in you.</p>

					<p>And I believe your heart and your mind already know what you must do.</p>

					<p>The only question left is - will you take that first step?</p>

								</h4>

							<div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<p>I remember the first time Morry worked his brainwave entrainment technology into a Mind Movie, and played it for me.</p>

									<p>My first reaction was actually: is that <em>it?</em></p>

									<p>The thing about Mind Movies Matrix is it goes <strong>deep</strong> into your subconscious... but on a conscious level it takes no effort whatsoever, except for just you concentrating on it for a few minutes.</p>

									<p>So is it hard? Absolutely not! All you need to do is first choose the area of life you want to work on. Remember the 4 areas are:</p>

									<p>
									1) Attracting wealth &amp; achievement
									<br>2) Enhancing &amp; deepening relationships
									<br>3) Weight loss &amp; optimal health
									<br>4) Finding or nurturing the perfect partner
									</p>

									<p>Then, you just use the Mind Movies Matrix set that corresponds to that area of life.</p>

									<p>You've got your 3-minute Matrix Mind Movie for the morning; these are laced with Morry's brainwave entrainment technology, and it's really quite amazing how they absorb positive messages into your subconscious mind, and how this short 3-minute experience can keep you in peak condition all day.</p>

									<p>Then in the evening, you turn up your speakers and listen to your 3-minute Subliminal Mind Movie that embeds millions of positive subliminal commands to sustain your peak condition.</p>

									<p>Plus you've got subliminal audios you can use as a booster for anytime throughout the day, and a sleep meditation audio to lock in your subconscious 'workout' even while you sleep.</p>

									<p>The entire system is super simple, super efficient, and yet surprisingly transformational. <strong>Anyone</strong> can use it, whether you're 8 or 80.</p>

								</h4>
							</div><!-- //.panel-heading -->
							<div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
								<div class="panel-body">
									
									<p>The results you get depend on the area of life you want to focus on. </p>

									<p>But generally, it boils down to highly noticeable upgrades in the quality of your thoughts, emotions, habits... and amazingly, even the people and circumstances you attract into your life.</p>

									<p>Let me give you an example.</p>

									<p>If you decide to focus on the wealth portion of the system, which is what many people do, then you can expect to find yourself developing an 'instinct' for abundance and achievement. </p>

									<p>You'll find your old habits and emotions that caused you to lose money will start melting away... like fear or procrastination or hesitation to make investments.</p>

									<p>You'll also find yourself more productive and focused at work, and even getting along better with your clients, co-workers and your boss.</p>

									<p>Plus you'll notice many more abundant opportunities, people and 'coincidences' start gravitating into your life...</p>

									<p>And what this really means is that the Universe itself starts aligning with the vibrations of your upgraded subconscious thoughts.</p>

									<p>It's not unusual for my students to report getting a bonus or a raise out of nowhere...</p>

									<p>Or a surprise check in the mail... </p>

									<p>Or a chance encounter with someone who ends up offering you a lucrative new job or even your dream career.</p>

									<p>Apart from wealth, you'll find many more experiences from our students on this page; each with their own unique goals and outcomes.</p>

									<p>As for how soon all this happens? </p>

									<p>That really depends on where you're at and where you want to be. Each person's subconscious and neurological development is different.</p>

									<p>But generally, it should take you anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months to start seeing meaningful changes in your thinking patterns, habits and emotions. </p>

									<p>Remember though, this doesn't mean changes aren’t taking place even way before you start noticing. </p>

									<p>Think of it like a seed that's been planted - you only see it once it sprouts, but that doesn't mean changes aren't happening beneath the surface.</p>

							<div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<p>Trust me, I completely understand if you're concerned about the price!</p>

									<p>Because yes, on the surface, $297 for a set of audios and videos <em>does</em> seem like a lot of money.</p>

									<p>But the thing is...</p>

									<p>You're not really investing in a set of audios and videos.</p>

									<p>You're not really investing in another personal growth home training program.</p>

									<p>And you're not even investing in the technology behind those audios, which we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of our lives to develop.</p>

									<p>What you're investing in are the <strong>results</strong> Mind Movies Matrix will create for you. </p>

									<p>You're investing in the subconscious 'upgrade', which will in turn open up all sorts of wins, breakthroughs, opportunities and outcomes in every area of life that matters to you.</p>

									<p>When you see it that way, can you really say you can't afford this investment? </p>

									<p>Wouldn't you invest $297 to earn more money and perform better in your career for the rest of your life? To get healthier and lose weight? To find or nurture your soul mate? Or to connect better with the people who matter? </p>

									<p>All these outcomes are <strong>priceless</strong>, and Mind Movies Matrix would still be a no-brainer even if it was ten times the price.</p>

									<p>And remember, if you need a more affordable payment plan, you can opt for two easy monthly payments of $178.99.</p>

									<p>Look, investing in yourself is the best kind of investment you can make. More so than any vacation you can take, or car you can buy, or nice dinner you can eat.</p>

									<p>I remember back before Mind Movies blew up, my partner Glen and I were struggling! </p>

									<p>We had trouble paying the office rent... we could barely hire any staff... and we went many months without paying ourselves a cent.</p>

									<p>But you know what we <strong>always</strong> set aside money for?</p>

									<p>Learning. </p>

									<p>We spent <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of dollars on workshops, books, training programs and technology to help us get to our peak, and <strong>stay</strong> there.</p>

									<p>Why? Because we knew that's what would ultimately make or break not just our business, but our lives.</p>

									<p>The investment paid off for us, and I know it will pay off for you too. So don't worry about the price.</p>

									<p>And the beauty of it is, once you start optimizing your subconscious, you'll find yourself get less and less busy.</p>

									<p>Mind Movies Matrix is the <strong>perfect</strong> complement to your Mind Movies 4.0 Creation Kit; in fact it will give you even better, faster and deeper results.</p>

									<p>Because while the Creation Kit allows you to design your own Mind Movies for highly specific and personalized goals, Matrix gives you a set of <em>premade</em> ones focusing on four essential areas of life that are crucial to your happiness, abundance and wellbeing - meaning you've got both your personal goals and your universal goals covered.</p>

									<p>In addition, the brainwave entrainment and subliminal technology infused into your Matrix Mind Movies will give you a uniquely immersive experience that is both different yet immediately familiar to your Creation Kit Mind Movies.</p>

									<p>As for how to use them, we recommend using your Matrix Mind Movies for 3 minutes in the morning and evening, and tapping into your personalized Creation Kit Mind Movies in the middle of the day. You can also try different Mind Movies on alternating days. What's important is that you create a pattern for your subconscious mind to latch onto, so it can start building new empowering neural pathways as quickly as possible.</p>

					<p class="text-italic text-light">When Gail Pence decided to try Mind Movies Matrix, she already owned the Mind Movies 4.0 Creation Kit, and had graduated from our Ultimate Success Masterclass.</p>

					<p class="text-italic text-light">To her, Mind Movies Matrix was a "booster" that would quicken the positive changes she was already enjoying through our other programs and technology.</p>

					<p class="text-italic text-light">"Since using Mind Movies Matrix, everything in my life is vibrating in and moving in a positive direction," says Gail. "I am energized, sleeping better, accomplishing more every day, and focusing my time and attention on my wealth and career, although there are positive manifestations happening in every area of my life." </p>

					<p class="text-italic text-light">Gail has even started receiving compliments from strangers telling her how great she looks, and how much they enjoy her positive personality.</p>

					<p class="text-italic text-light">"I know this is coming from the inner changes taking place as I immerse myself in all these fabulous tools," she explains. "Mind Movies Matrix utilizes cutting edge science that expedites the changes taking place in the brain and in your life."</p>

					<p class="text-italic text-light">Since focusing on other areas of her life, Gail has also lost 5 lbs in two weeks (with no conscious effort!), and experienced unexpected sums of money coming to her.</p>

					<p class="text-italic text-light">She adds: </p>

					<p class="text-italic text-light">"My suggestion to anyone wanting to make permanent and positive changes in their lives and the lives of others is to run, not walk, to your computer and get these fabulous tools to achieve your dreams."</p>
