				<p>And even if you've already experienced some progress on your journey...</p>

				<p>But is it just human nature to feel this way?

				<p>People like Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey, Tim Ferriss, Deepak Chopra...  </p>

				<p>And countless other unnamed 'superhumans' who somehow manifest their goals almost as fast as they can imagine them.</p>

					<p>A lot of people think personal growth coaches like me have nearly perfect lives.</p>

					<p>I mean, we should be practicing what we preach, right?</p>

					<p>Well I'm happy to report that today, I'm blessed with the life of my dreams... a business that helps millions of people... and the freedom to live on my personal terms.</p>

					<p>But a few years ago, I was a broke and exhausted entrepreneur.</p>

					<p>No matter how much I struggled, hustled and did the 'inner work'... I couldn't take my Mind Movies movement to the next level.</p>

					<p>I even constantly feared that people would out me as a phony.</p>

					<p>And as I began piecing together the Ultimate Success Formula, I realized precisely what was holding me back from being of full service to myself and others.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-12 text-left">

					<p>The Ultimate Success Formula taught me to start making small but profound <em>tweaks</em> to my daily life.</p>

					<p>And so I changed my habits. I became more conscious of my inner dialogue. I experimented with new personal growth tools and techniques that challenged and shook me up.</p>

					<p>The results showed within days, and intensified in the weeks that followed.</p>

					<p>I felt more confident. More focused and energized. More grateful, positive and empowered.</p>

					<p>And as this happened... my outer reality began shifting too.</p>

					<p>I saw a surge of interest in my Mind Movies movement. Tens of thousands of new students began flocking to us. And I experienced remarkable elevations in my finances, my health and even my relationships with my friends, co-workers and students.</p>

					<p>So it came as no surprise that when I started sharing this Ultimate Success Formula with my loved ones, <em>every single one</em> began experiencing similar breakthroughs in their lives.</p>

					<p>You're busy. Possibly even too busy (which is one of the many reasons people join us - to reduce their overwhelm and start living on their own terms).</p>

					<p>I get it, because I'm busy too. </p>

					<p>So I've designed USM to work <em>around</em> your busy life, instead of adding to your overwhelm - which is why you're free to study it at your own pace.</p>

					<p>Your daily rituals and Mastery exercises take just a few minutes to perform, and can be done at any time of day that feels best to you. As for your lessons, you can choose to spread them out over a few mornings or evenings, or instead, spend a couple hours of focus time on the weekend.</p>

					<p>You can even take a break when you find yourself extra busy with work or family.</p>

					<p>You also get direct access to friendly USM coaches eager to answer your questions and save you time and energy. Plus a host of easy-to-use productivity tools that make it easy (and FUN!) to stay on top of your USM tasks and trainings.</p>


					<h2 class="text-center text-dark-blue">The Ultimate Success Masterclass Gives You Direct Access To Our Tribe... And To Me</h2>

					<p>My intention with USM is to bring you as close as possible to a high-end mastermind experience... minus the high price and months of waiting.</p>

					<p>This means in-depth training with a personal touch - which includes a variety of engaging community features like forums, a secret Facebook page, a private message tool and insider-only events.</p>

					<p>You'll love connecting, co-creating and accelerating your results with kindred spirits on the same path as you - and who knows, you might even meet someone special you'll stay connected with for life.</p>

					<p>Plus, there's even an Ask Natalie section in your private membership site:</p>

					<p>I wonder -</p>

					<p>What would you give to wake up every morning with a huge grin on your face... </p>

					<p>Knowing you're living in <em>delicious</em> alignment with your passions, goals and dreams?</p>

					<p>Many people spend decades of time and untold sums of money on books, programs, seminars and coaching to slowly piece together that kind of life.</p>

					<p>But what if there was an <em>easier</em> way? A fast track to your Ultimate Success?</p>

					<p>My goal with the Ultimate Success Masterclass is to separate the wheat from the chaff... </p>

					<p>And give you nothing but the <u class="text-bold">best</u> peak performance and mind science wisdom available on the planet - synthesized into one lean, personalized and flexible curriculum.</p>

					<p>This is the cream of personal growth training. And it's also the closest you'll get to a high-end personal coaching experience - but at a tiny fraction of the price.</p>

					<p>Because while high-end personal coaching, seminars and courses can easily cost you tens of thousands of dollars (especially when you realize one is never enough!)...</p>

					<p>Your investment in the Ultimate Success Masterclass is a one-time payment of just $997.</p>

								<p>The curriculum is divided into 12 modules, each focusing on a unique element of the Ultimate Success Formula. Each module will take just a couple hours to complete, and you're free to study each one at your own pace. Aside from your lessons, you'll also have tools and Mastery exercises that take just a few minutes a day. So yes, there is some time commitment involved as you progress through the curriculum. But as the vast majority of our students will tell you, the personal breakthroughs and epiphanies you'll experience through USM make it one of the best things you'll ever do for yourself. Plus, USM will optimize your habits, focus, energy and productivity so that you ultimately become far less busy and stressed than before.</p>

								<p>You should expect to become a far better manifestor. You'll become more creative and intuitive. You'll become more in tune with your feelings, your passions and your desires. You'll connect better with people, have greater empathy and be more persuasive. You'll be more aligned with the vibrations of your surroundings, and you'll gain a sense of 'harmony' with the world around you. In a nutshell, all the personal growth and neuroscientific and psychological tools you get will elevate your mind, body and spirit to peak condition… and you'll grow into one of those people that others see as an inspiration and as proof that human potential is truly limitless. Then, what you do with this newfound power is totally up to you - maybe you'll use it to get ahead in your career? Your finances? Your love life or social circle? Or even just in your relationship with yourself? The possibilities are infinite.</p>
